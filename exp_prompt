# Use consistent variable names, explicit initialization, and describe input/output handling in detail, including cases with multiple values on a single line.
# Ensure each step in the algorithm is precise so that it can be implemented without ambiguity in any programming language.


{algorithm}
# Using the above algorithm, generate complete {target_lang} code.
# Ensure the code is self-contained, syntactically correct, and consistent with the variable names and structures in the algorithm.
# Preserve the exact input/output format and data flow described in the algorithm, including proper handling of multiple values per line and correct ordering of outputs.
# Avoid using variable names that shadow built-in functions or types in the target language.
# Before finalizing, verify that the code can run as-is without syntax errors and that it produces outputs exactly as described in the algorithm.
# Provide only the {target_lang} code, without comments, headers, explanations, or examples.
