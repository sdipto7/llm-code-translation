To solve this problem, we need to determine how many numbers from 1 to N are not present in any of the given lists. The solution involves reading the input data, collecting all the numbers that are present, and then calculating the difference between the total count (N) and the count of unique numbers present.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum and maximum number of distinct colors that can be used to categorize participants based on their arrival times. The arrival times are given in milliseconds, and the categorization is done by dividing the arrival time by 400. The problem also specifies that any arrival time of 3200 milliseconds or more (i.e., division by 400 results in 8 or higher) is considered a special case and should be counted separately.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points that can be obtained by switching from the first row to the second row at any possible position. The points are accumulated from the start of the first row up to the switch point and then from the switch point to the end of the second row.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the next lexicographical permutation of a given string that includes all 26 lowercase English letters. If the input string is already the last permutation (i.e., ""zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba""), we should return -1. If the string is shorter than 26 characters, we need to find the smallest missing character and append it to the string.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of integers that satisfy all the given conditions. Each condition is defined by a range, and we need to find the intersection of all these ranges. The solution involves finding the maximum lower bound and the minimum upper bound of all the ranges and then calculating the overlap between these bounds.

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given tree can be colored with two colors such that adjacent nodes connected by an edge with an even weight have the same color and those connected by an edge with an odd weight have different colors. The solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to check and apply the coloring constraints.

To solve this problem, we need to rearrange the elements of an array based on specific indexing and reversal rules. The goal is to generate a new array by taking elements from specific indices, reversing certain parts, and then combining them. The final output depends on whether the original array's length is even or odd.
