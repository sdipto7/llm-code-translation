    To solve this problem, we need to compute the integral of a function using a numerical approximation method. The problem involves summing up the areas of rectangles under the curve defined by the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) over a specific interval. The width of each rectangle is determined by the input value \( d \), and the height is determined by the function evaluated at each interval.

    To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways each integer up to a given number \( n \) can be expressed as a specific quadratic form. The quadratic form in question is \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + xz + yz \), where \( x, y, \) and \( z \) are integers ranging from 1 to 100. 
                                                                                                      ^
