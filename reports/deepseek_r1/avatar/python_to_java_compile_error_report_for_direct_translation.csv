To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given string should be converted to uppercase or lowercase based on the number of uppercase and lowercase letters it contains. The conversion is done such that if there are more uppercase letters, the entire string is converted to uppercase; otherwise, it is converted to lowercase.

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given sequence of movements results in a collision or a potential bug. The movements are given as a string of characters, each representing a direction ('L', 'R', 'U', 'D'). The goal is to check if the path taken by the object either revisits a previous position (collision) or if there's a potential bug where a new position is adjacent to another position that is not the previous one.
