    Now that I understand the Java code, I'll translate it into Python. Since Python syntax is different from Java, I need to map each Java construct to its Python equivalent.

    Translating the Java code directly to Python involves replacing Java constructs with their Python equivalents. Here's how each part can be translated:
                                                                                                                       ^
