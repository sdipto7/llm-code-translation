1. Import java.util.Scanner
2. Define class Main
3. Define public static void main(String[] args)
   - Create new Main instance
   - Call solve method
4. Declare private Scanner sc initialized with System.in
5. Define void solve()
   - Declare int N = sc.nextInt()
   - Declare int max, min
   - Read first integer input and assign to both max and min
   - For loop: i from 1 to N-1 (inclusive)
     - Declare int in = sc.nextInt()
     - Set max = maximum of max and in
     - Set min = minimum of min and in
   - Print (max - min)
