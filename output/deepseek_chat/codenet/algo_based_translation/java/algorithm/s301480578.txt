Algorithm:
- Import java.util.Scanner
- Define class Main
- Define main method with parameter String[] args
- Declare Scanner sc initialized with System.in
- Declare int n assigned from sc.nextInt()
- Declare int array h of size n
- For i from 0 to n-1: assign h[i] from sc.nextInt()
- Declare int max initialized to 0
- For l from 0 to n-2:
  - Declare int count initialized to 0
  - While l < n-1 AND h[l] >= h[l+1]:
    - Increment l by 1
    - Increment count by 1
  - Set max to maximum of max and count
- Print max
