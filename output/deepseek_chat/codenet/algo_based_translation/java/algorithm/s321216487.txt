**Function Signature:**
- `main(String[] args) throws Exception`

**Variables:**
- `Scanner sc` (Scanner object for input)
- `String S` (input string from user)
- `String begin` (substring from start to index i)
- `String end` (substring from index j to end)
- `String answer` (concatenation of begin and end)

**Libraries/Dependencies:**
- `java.util.Scanner`

**Algorithm:**
1. Create Scanner object to read from standard input
2. Read next string input into variable S
3. Initialize variables begin, end, answer as strings
4. For i from 0 to S.length() - 1:
   - For j from 0 to S.length() - 1:
     - Set begin = substring of S from index 0 to i (exclusive)
     - Set end = substring of S from index j to end of string
     - Set answer = concatenation of begin and end
     - If answer equals "keyence":
       - Print "YES"
       - Exit program
     - Else if begin equals "keyence":
       - Print "YES"
       - Exit program
     - Else if end equals "keyence":
       - Print "YES"
       - Exit program
5. If no match found in loops, print "NO"
