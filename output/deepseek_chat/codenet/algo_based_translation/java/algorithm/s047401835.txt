1. Read integer N from input
2. Initialize empty list of integers called numbers
3. For i from 0 to N-1:
   - Read next integer from input
   - Add integer to numbers list
4. Initialize integer count = 0
5. Do:
   - Filter numbers list to keep only even numbers (i % 2 == 0)
   - Map each remaining number to i / 2
   - Collect results into new numbers list
   - If size of numbers list equals N:
        - Increment count by 1
   - Continue while size of numbers list equals N
6. Print count
