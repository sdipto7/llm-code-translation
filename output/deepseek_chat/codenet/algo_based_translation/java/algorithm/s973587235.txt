**Function Signature:**
main(String[] args)

**Variables:**
- Scanner sc (input stream)
- int n (first input integer)
- int minN (second input integer minus 1)
- int i (loop counter)
- int h (temporary storage for each subsequent input)

**Libraries:**
java.util.Scanner

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize Scanner with System.in
2. Read integer n from input
3. Read integer, subtract 1, and store in minN
4. For i from 0 to n-2 (inclusive):
   - Read integer h
   - If minN equals h:
        Set minN = h
   - Else if minN equals h-1:
        Set minN = h-1
   - Else if minN is less than h-1:
        Set minN = h-1
   - Else if minN is greater than h:
        Print "No" and terminate program
5. After loop completes, print "Yes"
