Initialize Scanner object for reading standard input
Begin infinite loop
    Declare integer variable sum and initialize to 0
    Read next token from input as string s
    If s equals "0" then break out of loop
    For integer i from 0 to length of s minus 1
        Get character at position i from string s and assign to char variable a
        Convert character a to integer by subtracting '0' and add to sum
    Print sum followed by newline
End loop
Close Scanner
