1. Import Scanner from java.util
2. Define main method with String[] args parameter
3. Declare Scanner object 'scan' initialized with System.in
4. Read integer 'size' from input using scan.nextInt()
5. Declare 2D integer array 'graph' with dimensions [size][size]
6. Declare integer variables: id, cols
7. Declare integer array 'row' initialized to empty array
8. For i from 0 to size-1 (inclusive):
   a. Read integer 'id' from input
   b. Read integer 'cols' from input
   c. Initialize 'row' as new integer array of length 'size'
   d. For j from 0 to cols-1 (inclusive):
      i. Read integer from input and subtract 1 to get index
      ii. Set row[index] to 1
   e. Assign row to graph[id-1]
9. For i from 0 to graph.length-1 (inclusive):
   a. For j from 0 to graph[i].length-1 (inclusive):
      i. Print graph[i][j]
      ii. If j < graph[i].length-1, print space
   b. Print newline
10. End main method
