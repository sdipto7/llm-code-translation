Read input line, split by space
Parse first token as integer n
Parse second token as integer, convert to double d
Initialize integer cnt to 0

For i from 0 to n-1:
    Read input line, split by space
    Parse first token as integer, convert to double x
    Parse second token as integer, convert to double y
    Calculate sqrt(x*x + y*y)
    If result <= d:
        Increment cnt by 1

Print cnt
