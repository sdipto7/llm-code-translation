Algorithm:
- Import java.util.Scanner and java.lang.*
- Define class Main
- Define main method with parameter String[] args and no return
  - Declare Scanner sc initialized with System.in
  - Declare int t = sc.nextInt()
  - Declare int[] count with size t+1
  - For loop: i from 2 to t (inclusive) with increment 1
    - Read next integer from scanner
    - Increment count[sc.nextInt()] by 1
  - For loop: i from 1 to t (inclusive) with increment 1
    - Print count[i] followed by newline
