Initialize a 4x3x10 integer array 'info' with zeros.

Read integer 'n' from standard input.

For 'i' from 0 to n-1:
    Read integers 'built', 'floor', 'room', and 'num' from standard input.
    Increment info[built-1][floor-1][room-1] by 'num'.

For 'i' from 0 to 3:
    For 'j' from 0 to 2:
        For 'k' from 0 to 9:
            Print a space followed by info[i][j][k]
        Print a newline
    If 'i' is not 3:
        Print "####################" followed by a newline
