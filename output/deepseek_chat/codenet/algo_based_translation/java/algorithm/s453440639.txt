Read integers H and W from input
Read next line to consume newline
Declare 2D char array S with dimensions H x W
For i from 0 to H-1:
    Read string text from input
    For j from 0 to W-1:
        Set S[i][j] to j-th character of text

For i from 0 to H-1:
    For j from 0 to W-1:
        If S[i][j] equals '.':
            Initialize count to 0
            For a from -1 to 1:
                If i+a < 0 OR i+a >= H: continue to next a
                For b from -1 to 1:
                    If j+b < 0 OR j+b >= W: continue to next b
                    If S[i+a][j+b] equals '#': increment count by 1
            Set S[i][j] to character representation of count (by adding 48)
        Print S[i][j]
    Print newline character
