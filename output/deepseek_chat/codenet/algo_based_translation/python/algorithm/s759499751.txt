**Function Signature:**
main() -> None

**Variables:**
- n: int, k: int (from input)
- a: list[str] (from input)
- c: list[int] (length n, initialized to zeros)
- w: int (loop counter)
- l: int, r: int (from input)

**Algorithm:**
1. Read first line input: split into n and k (integers)
2. Read second line input: convert to list of characters 'a'
3. Initialize list 'c' of length n with zeros
4. For i from 1 to n-1 (inclusive):
   - If a[i] equals 'C' AND a[i-1] equals 'A':
        c[i] = c[i-1] + 1
   - Else:
        c[i] = c[i-1]
5. For w from 0 to k-1 (inclusive):
   - Read input line: split into l and r (integers)
   - Print c[r-1] - c[l-1]

**Input/Output:**
- Input: First line contains n k, second line contains string, subsequent k lines contain l r
- Output: k lines of integer results

**Dependencies:**
- Standard input/output operations
