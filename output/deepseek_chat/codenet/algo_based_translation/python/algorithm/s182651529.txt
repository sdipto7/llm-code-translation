Algorithm:
- Read two integers N and K from standard input
- Read a list of N integers as scores from standard input
- Initialize variable mae as integer with value 0
- Initialize variable usiro as integer with value K
- For i from 0 to N-K-1 (inclusive):
  - If score[mae] < score[usiro]:
    - Print "Yes"
  - Else:
    - Print "No"
  - Increment mae by 1
  - Increment usiro by 1
