Algorithm:
- Function: main (no parameters, no return value)
- Input: read string 's' from standard input
- Variables:
  - s: string
  - i: integer (loop counter)
  - c: character
  - j: integer (loop counter)
  - s1: string

Execution:
1. Read input string s
2. If length of s < 26:
   a. For i from 0 to 25 (inclusive):
      i. c = character at position 'a' + i
      ii. If c not in s:
          - Print s + c
          - Exit program
3. Else (length of s >= 26):
   a. For i from 25 down to 1 (inclusive):
      i. If s[i-1] < s[i]:
          - s1 = substring of s from index 0 to i-2 (inclusive)
          - For j from 0 to 25 (inclusive):
             * c = character at position 'a' + j
             * If c > s[i-1] AND c not in s1:
                - Print s1 + c
                - Exit program
   b. Print -1
4. End program
