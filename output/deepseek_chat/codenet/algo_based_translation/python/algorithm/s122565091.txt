Function: main
Parameters: none
Return type: void

Variables:
- a: integer
- v: integer
- b: integer
- w: integer
- t: integer

Algorithm:
1. Read first line of input and split into two integers, assign to a and v
2. Read second line of input and split into two integers, assign to b and w
3. Read third line of input as integer, assign to t
4. If a equals b:
   - Print 'YES'
5. Else if v is less than or equal to w:
   - Print 'NO'
6. Else:
   - Calculate absolute difference between a and b divided by (v minus w)
   - If t is less than this calculated value:
     - Print 'NO'
   - Else:
     - Print 'YES'
