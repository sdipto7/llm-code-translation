Algorithm:
1. Read two integers h and w from input, representing grid dimensions.
2. Initialize empty list l to store grid rows.
3. For each row from 0 to h-1:
   a. Read a string input and convert to list of characters
   b. Append this list to l
4. Initialize integer variable tmp to 0
5. For each row i from 0 to h-1:
   a. For each column j from 0 to w-1:
      i. If element at l[i][j] equals "#":
         - If j < tmp:
            * Print "Impossible"
            * Exit program
         - Else:
            * Set tmp = j
6. Print "Possible"
