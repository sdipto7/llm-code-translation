**Function Signature:**
- `main() -> None`

**Variables and Data Types:**
- `n: str` (unused input)
- `l: list[int]` (list of integers)
- `b: int` (maximum value in list)
- `s: int` (sum of list elements)

**Logic Flow:**
1. Read first input line and store as `n`
2. Read second input line, split into list of strings, convert to integers, store as `l`
3. Find maximum value in `l`, store as `b`
4. Calculate sum of all elements in `l`, store as `s`
5. Check if `b` is less than `s - b`
6. If true: print "Yes"
7. Else: print "No"

**Control Structures:**
- Single conditional: `if b < s - b:`

**Input/Output Operations:**
- Input: two lines from standard input
- Output: print "Yes" or "No"

**Dependencies:**
- Built-in functions: `input()`, `max()`, `sum()`, `print()`
- Built-in type conversion: `int()`
- Built-in method: `str.split()`
