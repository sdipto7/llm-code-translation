Function main():
    Read input: N, M, Q as integers from standard input
    Declare train as 2D list of integers with dimensions N x N, initialized to 0
    For M times:
        Read l, r as integers from standard input
        Increment train[l-1][r-1] by 1

    Declare accum as list of lists of integers, initialize with [0 for range(N+1)]
    For i from 0 to N-1:
        Declare temp as list of integers, initialize with [0]
        Declare v as integer, initialize to 0

            Add train[i][j] to v
            Append (accum[-1][j+1] + v) to temp
        Append temp to accum

        Calculate v = accum[q][q] - accum[p-1][q] - accum[q][p-1] + accum[p-1][p-1]
