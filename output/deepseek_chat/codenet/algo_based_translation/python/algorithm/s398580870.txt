n: int, k: int = input().split() and convert to integers
if k modulo 2 equals 1:
    result = (n integer division by k) raised to the power of 3
    print result
else:
    part1 = (n integer division by k) raised to the power of 3
    temp = n + (k integer division by 2)
    part2 = (temp integer division by k) raised to the power of 3
    result = part1 + part2
    print result
