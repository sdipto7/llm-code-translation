Function solver():
    Read integer N from standard input
    Declare list action as empty list
    For i from 0 to N-1:
        Read next line from input, split into integers, convert to list, append to action
    Declare 2D list dp with dimensions NÃ—3, initialized to zeros
    For i from 0 to 2:
        Set dp[0][i] = action[0][i]
    For i from 1 to N-1:
        dp[i][0] = maximum of (dp[i-1][1] + action[i][0]) and (dp[i-1][2] + action[i][0])
        dp[i][1] = maximum of (dp[i-1][0] + action[i][1]) and (dp[i-1][2] + action[i][1])
        dp[i][2] = maximum of (dp[i-1][0] + action[i][2]) and (dp[i-1][1] + action[i][2])
    Print maximum value from dp[N-1]
