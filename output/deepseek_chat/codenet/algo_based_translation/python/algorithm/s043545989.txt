Read integer N from input
Read list a of N integers from input
Create Counter object B from list a
Extract keys from B into list k
Extract values from B into list v

If length of B equals 3 AND XOR of all elements in k equals 0 AND all values in v are equal:
    Print "Yes"
Else if length of B equals 2 AND 0 is in k AND (first value equals twice second value OR second value equals twice first value):
    Print "Yes"
Else if length of B equals 1 AND 0 is in k:
    Print "Yes"
Else:
    Print "No"
