1. Read integer n from input
2. Read string s from input
3. Count occurrences of 'R' in s, store as r_cnt
4. Count occurrences of 'G' in s, store as g_cnt
5. Count occurrences of 'B' in s, store as b_cnt
6. Initialize ans = r_cnt * g_cnt * b_cnt
7. For i from 0 to n-1:
8.     For d from 1 to n-1:
9.         Calculate j = i + d
10.        Calculate k = j + d
11.        If k >= n: break inner loop
12.        If s[i] ≠ s[j] AND s[j] ≠ s[k] AND s[k] ≠ s[i]:
13.            Decrement ans by 1
14. Print ans
