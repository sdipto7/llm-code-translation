N: integer from input
ans: list of integers, initially empty

For i from 1 to N inclusive:
    Calculate sum of integers from 1 to i
    If sum < N:
        Continue to next iteration
    Else:
        Set ans = [i - 1, sum - N]
        Break out of loop

For j from 0 to ans[0] inclusive:
    If j + 1 != ans[1]:
        Print j + 1
