read integer n from input
initialize res as 0 (float)
for n iterations:
    read a line from input and split into two parts: x (string) and u (string)
    if u equals "BTC":
        convert x to float and multiply by 380000, add result to res
    else:
        convert x to integer and add to res
print res
