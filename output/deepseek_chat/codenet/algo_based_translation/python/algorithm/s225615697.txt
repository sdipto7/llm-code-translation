Read integer n from input
Read next line of input, split into list of integers a of length n

Declare integer m1 = (sum over i from 0 to n-1 of a[i] * (-1)^i) divided by 2

Convert m1 to string and store as result

Declare list m of length n with None values
Set m[0] = m1

For i from 1 to n-1:
    Set m[i] = a[i-1] - m[i-1]

Convert each element in m to string after multiplying by 2, join with spaces, and print
