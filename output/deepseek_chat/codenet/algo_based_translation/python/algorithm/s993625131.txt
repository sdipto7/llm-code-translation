**Function Signature:**
- No explicit function defined; main script execution

**Variables:**
- `S`: list of characters (from input string conversion)
- `count`: integer (initialized to 0)
- `record`: integer (initialized to 0)

**Input Operation:**
- Read input string and convert to list of characters

**Logic Flow:**
1. Initialize `count = 0`
2. Initialize `record = 0`
3. For each index `i` from 0 to length(S)-1:
   - If S[i] equals "A" OR "C" OR "G" OR "T":
     - Increment `count` by 1
   - Else:
     - If `count` > `record`:
       - Set `record` = `count`
     - Reset `count` = 0
4. After loop completion:
   - If `count` > `record`:
     - Set `record` = `count`
5. Print `record`

**Control Structures:**
- For loop: iterates through all indices of list S
- Conditional checks: character membership in {"A", "C", "G", "T"}
- Conditional update: comparing current count with record

**Output Operation:**
- Print integer value of `record`

**Dependencies:**
- None (uses built-in input() and list operations)
