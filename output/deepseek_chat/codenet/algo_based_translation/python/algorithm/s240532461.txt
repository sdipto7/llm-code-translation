read N and L as integers from input
initialize empty list aji
for i from 1 to N inclusive:
    append (L + i - 1) to aji

if minimum value in aji >= 0:
    find index of minimum value in aji
    remove element at that index from aji
else if maximum value in aji <= 0:
    find index of maximum value in aji
    remove element at that index from aji
else:
    find index of element with smallest absolute value in aji
    remove element at that index from aji

calculate sum of remaining elements in aji
print the sum
