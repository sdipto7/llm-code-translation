Read integer n from input
Initialize list F with n tuples of 10 integers each from input
Initialize list P with n tuples of 11 integers each from input
Initialize ans to negative infinity equivalent (-10**18)

For each integer i from 1 to 1023 (2^10 - 1):
    Initialize tmp to 0
    Initialize lst as list of n zeros
    
    For each j from 0 to 9:
        If the j-th bit of i is set:
            For each k from 0 to n-1:
                Add F[k][j] to lst[k]
    
    For each k from 0 to n-1:
        Add P[k][lst[k]] to tmp
    
    Set ans to maximum of ans and tmp

Print ans
