**Function Signature:**
- main(): void

**Variables:**
- N: int
- A: list of int
- B: list of int
- ans: int
- i: int (loop counter)
- d: int (temporary calculation variable)

**Input Operations:**
- Read integer N from standard input
- Read next line, split into integers, store in list A
- Read next line, split into integers, store in list B

**Initialization:**
- Set ans = 0

**Main Logic:**
- For i from 0 to N-1:
  - Set d = minimum of A[i] and B[i]
  - Add d to ans
  - Subtract d from A[i]
  - Subtract d from B[i]
  - Set d = minimum of A[i+1] and B[i]
  - Add d to ans
  - Subtract d from A[i+1]
  - Subtract d from B[i]

**Output Operation:**
- Print ans
