**Function Signature:**
- main(): void

**Variables:**
- N: int
- H: list[int]
- count_best: int
- count_tmp: int
- i: int (loop index)

**Input Operations:**
- Read integer N from standard input
- Read space-separated integers and convert to list H

**Initialization:**
- count_best = 0
- count_tmp = 0

**Main Logic:**
- For i from 0 to N-2 (inclusive):
  - If H[i] >= H[i+1]:
    - Increment count_tmp by 1
  - Else:
    - If count_tmp > count_best:
      - Set count_best = count_tmp
    - Reset count_tmp to 0

- After loop completion:
  - If count_tmp > count_best:
    - Set count_best = count_tmp

**Output Operation:**
- Print count_best

**Dependencies:**
- Standard input/output functions
