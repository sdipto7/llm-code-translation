N: integer from input
A: list of integers from input
ans: integer = absolute value of last element of A
A: list = [0] + A + [0]
diff: list of zeros with length N

For i from 1 to N (inclusive):
    dif: integer = |A[i] - A[i-1]| + |A[i] - A[i+1]| - |A[i-1] - A[i+1]|
    ans: integer = ans + |A[i] - A[i-1]|
    diff[i-1] = dif

For i from 0 to N-1:
    Print: ans - diff[i]
