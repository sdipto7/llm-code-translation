**Function Signature:**
- solve(): void (no parameters, no return value)

**Variables and Data Types:**
- S_d: list of characters (from input string)
- T: list of characters (from input string)
- end: integer (index position)
- first: integer (index position)
- t_i: integer (index counter)
- s_i: integer (index counter)
- ans: list of characters (deep copy of S_d)

**Libraries/Dependencies:**
- copy module (for deepcopy operation)

**Algorithm Flow:**

1. Read input string S_d and convert to character list
2. Read input string T and convert to character list
3. Initialize end = len(S_d) - 1
4. Initialize first = end - len(T) + 1
5. Enter while loop with condition: first >= 0
6. Inside while loop:
   - Initialize t_i = 0
   - Enter for loop with s_i from first to end (inclusive)
   - Check if T[t_i] ≠ S_d[s_i] AND S_d[s_i] ≠ '?'
   - If condition is true: break out of for loop
   - Else: increment t_i by 1
   - If for loop completes without break: break out of while loop
7. If while loop completes without break:
   - Print 'UNRESTORABLE'
   - Exit program with code 0
8. Create deep copy of S_d as ans
9. Initialize t_i = 0
10. Enter for loop with i from first to end (inclusive)
    - Set ans[i] = T[t_i]
    - Increment t_i by 1
11. Convert ans list to string and replace all '?' with 'a'
12. Print the resulting string
