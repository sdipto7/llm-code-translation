Read integer N from input
Read next line, split by space to get list V_str
Convert each element in V_str to integer, store in list V
Read next line, split by space to get list C_str
Convert each element in C_str to integer, store in list C
Initialize list named list with single element 0
Initialize integer ans to 0
Initialize integer X to 0
Initialize integer Y to 0
For i from 0 to N-1:
    If V[i] - C[i] > 0:
        Set X = V[i]
        Set Y = C[i]
        Append (X - Y) to list
Compute sum of all elements in list
Print the sum
