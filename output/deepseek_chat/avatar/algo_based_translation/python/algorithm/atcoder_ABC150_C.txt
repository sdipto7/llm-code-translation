import itertools module
generate all permutations of numbers from 1 to n inclusive, store as list in orig
read first sequence of integers from input, convert to tuple p
read second sequence of integers from input, convert to tuple q
find index of p in orig list, store as pn
find index of q in orig list, store as qn
calculate absolute difference between pn and qn
print the result
