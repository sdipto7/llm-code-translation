1. Read a string input from standard input and assign to variable `a`
2. Declare list `vo` containing vowel characters: ['a','e','i','o','u','y','A','E','I','O','U','Y']
3. Initialize loop counter `i` starting from last index of string `a` (len(a)-1), decrementing by 1 each iteration until reaching -1
4. For each iteration:
   - Check if character at position `i` in string `a` is either space (' ') or question mark ('?')
   - If condition is true: skip current iteration and continue to next character
   - Else:
     - Check if character at position `i` exists in list `vo`
     - If vowel found: print "YES" to standard output
     - Else: print "NO" to standard output
     - Exit loop immediately after printing result
5. If loop completes without finding non-space/non-question-mark character, no output is produced
