n: integer from input
arr: list of integers from input, truncated to length n
ans: list of integers of length n, initialized to zeros
mx: integer, initialized to last element of arr

for i from n-2 down to 0 (inclusive):
    ans[i] = max(0, mx - arr[i] + 1)
    if arr[i] > mx:
        mx = arr[i]

print all elements of ans separated by spaces
