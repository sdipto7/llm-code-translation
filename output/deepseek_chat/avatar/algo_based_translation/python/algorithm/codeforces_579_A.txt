**Function Signature:**
- main(): void

**Variables:**
- n: int (input from user)
- x: int (initialized to 1)

**Libraries:**
- math

**Logic Flow:**
1. Read integer input from user and store in n
2. Initialize x to 1
3. Enter while loop condition: math.log2(n) modulo 1 != 0
4. Inside loop:
   - Increment x by 1
   - Subtract 2 raised to integer part of log2(n) from n
5. After loop exits, print value of x

**Control Structures:**
- While loop: continues while math.log2(n) % 1 != 0 (while n is not a power of two)
- Loop body: x += 1; n -= 2**(int(math.log2(n)))
