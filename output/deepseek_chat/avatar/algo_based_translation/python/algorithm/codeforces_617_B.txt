1. Import the `prod` function from the `math` module
2. Read and discard the first input line
3. Read the second input line and store it as string variable `a`
4. Count occurrences of "1" in string `a`
5. If count equals 0:
   - Print 0
6. Else:
   - Strip all "0" and space characters from both ends of `a`
   - Split the resulting string by "1" character into a list of substrings
   - For each substring in the resulting list:
     - Count occurrences of "0" in the substring
     - Add 1 to this count
   - Calculate the product of all values in the resulting list
   - Print the product
