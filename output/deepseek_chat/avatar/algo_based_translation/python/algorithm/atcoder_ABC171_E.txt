1. Import functools.reduce and operator.xor
2. Read integer N from stdin
3. Read next line from stdin, split into list of strings, convert each to integer, store in list 'a'
4. Initialize variable 'total' with reduce operation: apply xor across all elements of 'a' starting with initial value 0
5. For each element 'ai' in list 'a':
   - Compute ai XOR total
   - Convert result to string
6. Join all resulting strings with space separator
7. Print the joined string
