1. Read input string and split by space into list xxs
2. Assign:
   x = int(xxs[0])
   t = int(xxs[1])
   a = int(xxs[2])
   b = int(xxs[3])
   da = int(xxs[4])
   db = int(xxs[5])

3. Define function main() with no parameters, returns string
4. If x equals 0:
   - Print "YES"
   - Return "Result Found"

5. Calculate:
   a_time = minimum of (a divided by da) and (t - 1)
   b_time = minimum of (b divided by db) and (t - 1)

6. For i from 0 to a_time (inclusive):
   For j from 0 to b_time (inclusive):
      If (a - da*i) equals x OR (b - db*j) equals x:
         - Print "YES"
         - Return "Result Found"
      If (a - da*i) + (b - db*j) equals x:
         - Print "YES"
         - Return "Result Found"

7. Return "Result Not Found"

8. Call main() and store result in ff
9. If ff equals "Result Not Found":
   - Print "NO"
