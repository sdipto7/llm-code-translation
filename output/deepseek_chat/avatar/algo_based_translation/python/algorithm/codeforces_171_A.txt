Algorithm:
- Import sys module
- Define input function as sys.stdin.readline
- Read input string, remove last character (newline), split into two strings a and b
- Let x = maximum length of a and b
- Pad a with leading zeros to length x using rjust
- Pad b with trailing zeros to length x using ljust
- Initialize empty string s
- Initialize integer c = 0
- For i from 0 to x-1:
    - Let d = integer value of b[i] + integer value of a[x-i-1] + c
    - If d > 9:
        - Append second digit of d (as string) to s
        - Set c = 1
    - Else:
        - Append d (as string) to s
        - Set c = 0
- If c == 1:
    - Append '1' to s
- Reverse s and convert to integer
- Print the integer result
