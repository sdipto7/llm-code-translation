Initialize an empty list L
Read and discard first input line
Initialize integer r to 1
Read next input line and split into tokens
For each token k in the split tokens:
    Convert k to integer
    Append r to list L repeated integer(k) times
    Increment r by 1
Read and discard next input line
Read next input line and split into tokens
For each token j in the split tokens:
    Convert j to integer
    Subtract 1 from integer(j) to get index
    Print element from L at calculated index
