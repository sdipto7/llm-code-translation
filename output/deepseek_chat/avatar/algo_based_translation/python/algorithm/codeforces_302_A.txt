Read n and m as integers from input
Read next line and count occurrences of '-' character, store as sa
Set sa to minimum of (n - sa) and sa
Initialize empty list ss
For m times:
    Read two integers a and b from input
    Subtract a from b
    Calculate condition: (b mod 2 != 0) AND (b <= sa * 2)
    If condition is true, append "1\n" to ss, else append "0\n"
Join all elements in ss and print the resulting string
