**Function Signature:**
- No explicit function defined; main script execution

**Variables and Data Types:**
- `input`: function reference (from sys.stdin.readline)
- `n`: integer (read from input)
- `s`: list of strings (from processed input)
- `w`: Counter object (dictionary-like with string keys and integer values)
- `c`: integer (initialized to -1)
- `a`: string (initialized to empty string equivalent)
- `i`: string (loop variable)

**Libraries/Dependencies:**
- sys module
- collections.Counter

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. Read integer `n` from standard input
2. Read next line from standard input, remove last character (newline), split into list of strings `s`
3. Create frequency counter `w` from list `s`
4. Reverse list `s` and reassign to `s`
5. Initialize `c` to -1 and `a` to empty value
6. For each key `i` in counter `w`:
   - If frequency count `w[i]` equals maximum value in `w.values()`:
     - If index of first occurrence of `i` in reversed list `s` is greater than `c`:
       - Set `a` to `i`
       - Set `c` to index of first occurrence of `i` in reversed list `s`
7. Print value of `a`
