N = integer input from user
A = list of tuples: for each index i and value x in split input string, create tuple (i+1, integer(x))
A_ = sort list A by second element of each tuple (the integer value)
A__ = list containing only first elements (original indices) from each tuple in A_
For each element i in all elements of A__ except last:
    print i followed by space (no newline)
Print last element of A__ (with newline)
