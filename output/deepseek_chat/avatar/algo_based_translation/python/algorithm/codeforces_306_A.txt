1. Read two integers `n` and `m` from standard input
2. Calculate integer division quotient: `q = n // m`
3. Calculate remainder: `r = n % m`
4. Create list `a` of length `m` with all elements initialized to `q`
5. For `i` from `0` to `r-1`:
   - Increment `a[i]` by 1
6. For `i` from `0` to `m-1`:
   - Print `a[i]` followed by a space
7. Output ends with trailing space
