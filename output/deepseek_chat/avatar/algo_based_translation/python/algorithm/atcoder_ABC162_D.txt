Read integer N from input
Read string S from input
Define function calculate(n: int, s: str) -> None:
    Convert s to list arr
    Count occurrences of "R" in arr -> rNum
    Count occurrences of "G" in arr -> gNum
    Count occurrences of "B" in arr -> bNum
    Initialize sum = 0
    For step from 1 to ceil(n/2) inclusive:
        For i from 0 to n - 2*step - 1 inclusive:
            Create string s by concatenating arr[i], arr[i+step], arr[i+2*step]
            If s equals "RGB" OR "RBG" OR "BGR" OR "BRG" OR "GBR" OR "GRB":
                Increment sum by 1
    Print rNum * gNum * bNum - sum
Call calculate(N, S)
