Algorithm:
- Import numpy module as np
- Read integer N from standard input
- Read next line from standard input, split into list of strings, convert each to integer, store in list n
- Convert list n to numpy array
- Initialize integer variable a = 1
- Initialize integer variable pos = 0
- For integer i from 1 to N-1 (inclusive):
    - If element at index pos in array n is greater than element at index i:
        - Increment a by 1
        - Set pos = i
- Print value of a
