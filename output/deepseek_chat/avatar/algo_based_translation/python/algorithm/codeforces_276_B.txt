Function: main
Parameters: none
Return: void

Variables:
- s: list of characters (from input string)
- x: boolean (initialized to True)
- dt: dictionary (key: character, value: integer)
- i: character (loop variable)
- key: character (dictionary key)
- value: integer (dictionary value)
- cnt: integer (initialized to 0)

Logic Flow:
1. Read input string and convert to list of characters, store in s
2. Initialize x to True
3. Initialize empty dictionary dt
4. For each character i in list s:
   - If i exists as key in dt:
        Increment dt[i] by 1
   - Else:
        Set dt[i] to 1
5. Initialize cnt to 0
6. Set x to True
7. For each key-value pair in dt.items():
   - If value is odd AND cnt < 1:
        Increment cnt by 1
   - Else if value is odd AND cnt >= 1:
        Set x to False
        Break loop
8. If x is True:
        Print "First"
9. Else if x is False AND length of s is even:
        Print "Second"
10. Else if x is False AND length of s is odd:
        Print "First"
