**Function Signature:**
- No explicit function defined; main script execution

**Input Operations:**
- Read integer `n` from standard input
- Read next line, split into list of integers `l` of length `n`

**Variable Declarations:**
- `n`: integer (number of elements)
- `l`: list of integers (input numbers)
- `high`: integer, initialized to 1 (current consecutive count)
- `tower`: integer, initialized to `n` (number of distinct values)
- `maximum`: integer, initialized to 1 (maximum consecutive count)

**Data Processing:**
- Sort list `l` in ascending order

**Loop Structure:**
- For loop: `i` from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive)
  - Condition: if `l[i] == l[i-1]`
    - Then: decrement `tower` by 1, increment `high` by 1
  - Else:
    - Condition: if `high > maximum`
      - Then: set `maximum = high`
    - Reset `high = 1`

**Post-Loop Check:**
- Condition: if `high > maximum`
  - Then: set `maximum = high`

**Output Operation:**
- Print `maximum` and `tower` as space-separated values

**Dependencies:**
- Built-in functions: `input`, `int`, `map`, `list`, `split`, `sort`, `print`
- No external libraries required
