1. Read integer `n` from input
2. Read next line, split into list of strings, convert each to integer, store in list `l1`
3. Sort list `l1` in ascending order
4. Assign last element of `l1` to variable `a` (maximum value)
5. Assign first element of `l1` to variable `b` (minimum value)
6. Check if `a` equals `b`
   - If true:
     - Calculate difference: `a - b`
     - Calculate count: `n * (n - 1) // 2`
     - Print both values
   - Else:
     - Count occurrences of `a` in `l1`, store in `ac`
     - Count occurrences of `b` in `l1`, store in `bc`
     - Calculate difference: `a - b`
     - Calculate product: `ac * bc`
     - Print both values
