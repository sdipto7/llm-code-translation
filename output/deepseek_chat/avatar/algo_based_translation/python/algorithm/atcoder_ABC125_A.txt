1. Function signature: main() -> None
2. Variables:
   - a: int
   - b: int
   - t: int
   - cookie: int (initialized to 0)
   - time: float (initialized to a)
3. Input operation:
   - Read one line from standard input
   - Split into three strings
   - Convert each to int
   - Assign to a, b, t respectively
4. Loop structure:
   - while time <= t + 0.5:
     - cookie = cookie + b
     - time = time + a
5. Output operation:
   - Print cookie value as integer
