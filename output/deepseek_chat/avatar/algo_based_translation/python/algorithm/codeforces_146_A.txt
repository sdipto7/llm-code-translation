1. Read integer `n` from input
2. Read a string from input, convert to list of characters, map each to integer, store as list `number`
3. Initialize integer `h1` to 0
4. Initialize integer `h2` to 0
5. Initialize integer `x` to 0
6. For each integer `i` from 0 to n-1:
   - If `number[i]` is not equal to 4 AND not equal to 7:
     - Print "NO"
     - Increment `x` by 1
     - Break out of loop
   - If `i` is less than n//2:
     - Add `number[i]` to `h1`
   - Else:
     - Add `number[i]` to `h2`
7. If `x` equals 0:
   - If `h1` equals `h2`:
     - Print "YES"
   - Else:
     - Print "NO"
