Function: solve_case
Parameters: None
Return: None

Input:
- Read integers n, m from input
- Initialize count as 2D list of size nÃ—n with zeros
- Initialize ans = -1

For k from 0 to m-1:
    Read integers x, y from input
    Decrement x and y by 1
    Set found = False
    
    For i from x-2 to x:
        For j from y-2 to y:
            If i >= 0 and i < n and j >= 0 and j < n:
                Increment count[i][j] by 1
                If count[i][j] == 9:
                    Set found = True
    
    If found is True:
        Set ans = k + 1
        Break out of loop

Print ans
