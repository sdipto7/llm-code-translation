1. Import sys module
2. Define input function as sys.stdin.readline
3. Read integer n from input
4. Read next line, split into list of strings, convert to integers, store as list w
5. Calculate x = sum of all elements in w
6. Initialize empty list d
7. For i from 0 to n-1:
   - Calculate (x - w[i]) / (n - 1)
   - If result equals w[i]:
        Append (i + 1) to list d
8. Print length of list d
9. Convert elements of d to strings, join with spaces, and print result
