**Function Signature:**
- main(): void

**Variables:**
- A: int, B: int, C: int, D: int (input integers)
- m: int = 998244353 (modulus constant)
- d: 2D list of integers with dimensions (C+1) x (D+1)
- i: int (loop counter)
- j: int (loop counter)

**Input Operations:**
- Read four space-separated integers from standard input and assign to A, B, C, D

**Initialization:**
- Initialize 2D array d with zeros
- Set d[A][B] = 1

**Main Logic:**
- For i from A to C (inclusive):
  - For j from B to D (inclusive):
    - Update d[i][j] using recurrence:
      d[i][j] = (d[i][j] + (d[i][j-1] * i + d[i-1][j] * j - d[i-1][j-1] * (i-1) * (j-1))) % m

**Output Operation:**
- Print d[C][D]
