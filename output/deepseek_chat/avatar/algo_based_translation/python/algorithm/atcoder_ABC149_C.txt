**Function Signature:**
- main(): None (implicit)

**Variables:**
- X: int (input value)
- prime: list[bool] of size 100010

**Algorithm:**
1. Read integer input X from standard input
2. Initialize prime as list of 100010 boolean values, all set to True
3. Set prime[0] = False
4. Set prime[1] = False
5. For i from 4 to 100009 (inclusive), stepping by 2:
   - Set prime[i] = False
6. Set i = 3
7. While i*i <= 100008:
   - If prime[i] is True:
     - For j from i+i to 100007 (inclusive), stepping by i:
       - Set prime[j] = False
   - Increment i by 2
8. For i from X to 100007 (inclusive):
   - If prime[i] is True:
     - Print i
     - Break out of loop
