**Function Signature:**
- No explicit function defined; main execution block

**Input Operations:**
- Read first line: split into two integers `a` and `at`
- Read second line: split into two integers `b` and `bt`
- Read third line: split by colon into two integers `t1` and `t2`

**Variable Declarations and Data Types:**
- `a`: integer (bus interval)
- `at`: integer (bus travel time)
- `b`: integer (train interval)
- `bt`: integer (train travel time)
- `t1`: integer (hour part of departure time)
- `t2`: integer (minute part of departure time)
- `st`: integer (converted departure time in minutes from 5:00)
- `fin`: integer (arrival time in minutes from 5:00)
- `now`: integer (current time counter, initialized to 0)
- `ans`: integer (count of overlapping trains, initialized to 0)

**Data Processing Logic:**
- Calculate `st = t2 + (t1 - 5) * 60`
- Calculate `fin = st + at`

**Control Structure (While Loop):**
- Condition: `now < fin AND now < 1140`
- Loop body:
  - If `now + bt > st` then increment `ans` by 1
  - Increment `now` by `b`
- After loop: print `ans`

**Output Operation:**
- Print integer `ans`
