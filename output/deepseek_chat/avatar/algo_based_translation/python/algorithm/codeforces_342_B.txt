R: function that reads a line of input, splits it, and converts each element to integer
n: integer, read from first input
m: integer, read from first input  
s: integer, read from first input
f: integer, read from first input

If s < f:
    d = 1
    c = 'R'
Else:
    d = -1
    c = 'L'

res = empty string
i = 1
j = s
t, l, r = read next three integers from input
k = 1

While j != f:
    If i > t and k < m:
        t, l, r = read next three integers from input
        k = k + 1
    If i == t and (l <= j <= r or l <= j + d <= r):
        Append 'X' to res
    Else:
        Append c to res
        j = j + d
    i = i + 1

Print res
