1. Read input line from stdin
2. Split input string by space into list of strings
3. Convert each string in list to integer
4. Assign first integer to variable h (type: int)
5. Assign second integer to variable a (type: int)
6. Calculate integer division: sho = h // a (type: int)
7. Calculate remainder: am = h % a (type: int)
8. If am != 0:
   - Increment sho by 1
9. Else:
   - Do nothing (pass)
10. Print sho value to stdout
