Algorithm:
1. Function: main (implicit, no parameters, no return)
2. Variables:
   - u: function reference to input
   - n: integer
   - k: integer
   - M: list of integers
   - m: integer (unused)
   - j: integer (loop counter)
   - p: integer (loop counter and index)
   - l: integer (loop counter)
3. Input operations:
   - Read first line: split into two integers n and k
   - Read second line: split into list of integers M
4. Initialize m = 0
5. Outer loop: for j from 0 to n-1 (inclusive)
   - Inner loop: for p from 0 to n-1 (inclusive)
     - Condition: if M[p] == 0
       - Print: p+1 with space separator (no newline)
       - Break inner loop
   - Inner loop: for l from 0 to (p - k) inclusive
     - Operation: M[l] = M[l] - 1
   - Operation: M[p] = M[p] - 1
6. No explicit return
