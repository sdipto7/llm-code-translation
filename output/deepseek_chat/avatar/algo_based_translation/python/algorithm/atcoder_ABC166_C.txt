1. Read two integers n and m from input
2. Create list p containing integers from 1 to n inclusive
3. Read n integers from input and store in list h
4. Create dictionary hp mapping each element in p to corresponding element in h
5. Initialize dictionary path with keys 1 to n, each with empty list value
6. For m times:
   a. Read two integers a and b from input
   b. Append b to path[a]
   c. Append a to path[b]
7. Initialize counter c to 0
8. For each key i and value v in path.items():
   a. Initialize flag f to 0
   b. For each value j in v:
      i. If hp[i] <= hp[j]:
         1. Set f to 1
         2. Break inner loop
   c. If f equals 0:
      i. Increment c by 1
9. Print value of c
