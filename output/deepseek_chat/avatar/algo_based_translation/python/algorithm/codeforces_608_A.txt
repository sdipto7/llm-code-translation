Algorithm:
- Import sys module
- Define input function as sys.stdin.readline
- Read first line of input, split into two integers: n and s
- Initialize variable c as integer with value 0
- For loop: iterate n times
  - Read each subsequent line, split into two integers: f and t
  - Calculate x = t - (s - f)
  - If x > c then set c = x
- After loop: print s + c
