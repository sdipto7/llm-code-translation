Read integer n from input
Read next line from input, split into list m of strings
Declare boolean variable possible = True
Create set from m, iterate over each unique element i in set:
    Count occurrences of i in m
    If count >= (n / 2 + 1):
        Set possible = False
        Break loop
If possible is True: print "YES"
Else: print "NO"
