Read input: N, X, and list A from stdin
Convert input to integers
Compute cumulative sum list S of A using accumulate
Initialize ans to positive infinity
For k from 1 to length of S (inclusive):
    Calculate E = k * X + 2 * sum of S[j] for j from N-2*k-1 down to 0 with step -k
    Update ans to minimum of current ans and E
Compute final result = ans + N * X + 5 * last element of S
Print final result
