Read input string s and set integer l = 2019
Initialize list m with length l+1: first element 1, remaining elements 0
Initialize integers a = 0 and r = 0
Reverse string s and iterate over each character e with index i:
    Convert e to integer
    Compute power: (10^i) mod l
    Multiply integer e by computed power mod result
    Add result to a
    Compute remainder: a mod l
    Add m[remainder] to r
    Increment m[remainder] by 1
After loop completion, output r
