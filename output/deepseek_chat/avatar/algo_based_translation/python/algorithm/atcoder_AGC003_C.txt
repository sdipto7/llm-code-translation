**Input Processing:**
- Read integer N from standard input
- Declare list A of size N: elements are computed as (input integer * N) + index, for each index from 0 to N-1
- Sort list A in ascending order

**Variable Declarations:**
- cnt: integer counter initialized to 0

**Main Logic:**
- For each index i from 0 to N-1:
  - Compute d = (A[i] mod N) mod 2
  - If (d mod 2) â‰  (i mod 2):
    - Increment cnt by 1

**Output:**
- Print cnt divided by 2 using integer division
