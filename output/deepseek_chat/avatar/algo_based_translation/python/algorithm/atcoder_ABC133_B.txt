import math
Read integer n and integer d from input
Initialize points as an empty list
For n times:
    Read a list of d integers from input and append to points
Define function dist with parameters x (list of numbers) and y (list of numbers) returning float:
    Initialize tmp as 0.0
    For i from 0 to d-1:
        Add (x[i] - y[i]) squared to tmp
    Return square root of tmp
Initialize count as 0
For i from 0 to n-1 with element elm = points[i]:
    For j from i+1 to n-1:
        Calculate distance = dist(elm, points[j])
        If distance is an integer (has no fractional part):
            Increment count by 1
Print count
