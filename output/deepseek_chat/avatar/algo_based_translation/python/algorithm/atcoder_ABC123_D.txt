Read integers x, y, z, k from input
Read list a of x integers from input
Read list b of y integers from input
Read list c of z integers from input

Initialize empty list ab
For i from 0 to x-1:
    For j from 0 to y-1:
        Append a[i] + b[j] to list ab

Sort list ab in descending order

Initialize empty list abc
Let limit = min(k, x*y)
For i from 0 to limit-1:
    For j from 0 to z-1:
        Append ab[i] + c[j] to list abc

Sort list abc in descending order

For i from 0 to k-1:
    Print abc[i]
