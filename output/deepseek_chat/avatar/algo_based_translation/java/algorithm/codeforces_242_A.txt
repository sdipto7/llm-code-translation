**Function Signature:**
main(String[] args) -> void

**Variables:**
- Scanner in (Scanner object for input)
- int x, y, a, b (input integers)
- int count (counter initialized to 0)

**Input Operations:**
- Read integer x from standard input
- Read integer y from standard input
- Read integer a from standard input
- Read integer b from standard input

**Algorithm Logic:**
1. Initialize count to 0
2. Outer loop: i from a to x (inclusive)
3. Inner loop: j from b to y (inclusive)
4. Check condition: if i <= j, skip to next iteration
5. Otherwise: increment count by 1
6. After counting: Print total count
7. Outer loop: i from a to x (inclusive)
8. Inner loop: j from b to y (inclusive)
9. Check condition: if i <= j, skip to next iteration
10. Otherwise: print i and j separated by space
11. Close Scanner object

**Control Structures:**
- Nested for loops with range conditions:
  - Outer: i = a; i <= x; i++
  - Inner: j = b; j <= y; j++
- Conditional continue: if (i <= j)

**Required Dependencies:**
- java.util.Scanner
