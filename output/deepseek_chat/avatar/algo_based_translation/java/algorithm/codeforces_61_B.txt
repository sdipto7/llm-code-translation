**Function Signature:**
main(String[] args)

**Variables:**
- Scanner in (input scanner)
- String word1 (processed first input line)
- String word2 (processed second input line)
- String word3 (processed third input line)
- String perm1 through perm6 (all permutations of word concatenations)
- int students (number of test cases)
- String testCase (processed student input line)

**Libraries:**
- java.util.Scanner

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize Scanner object for input
2. Read first line, remove non-alphabetic characters, convert to lowercase → store as word1
3. Read second line, remove non-alphabetic characters, convert to lowercase → store as word2
4. Read third line, remove non-alphabetic characters, convert to lowercase → store as word3
5. Generate all 6 permutations of concatenating word1, word2, word3:
   - perm1 = word1 + word2 + word3
   - perm2 = word1 + word3 + word2
   - perm3 = word2 + word1 + word3
   - perm4 = word2 + word3 + word1
   - perm5 = word3 + word2 + word1
   - perm6 = word3 + word1 + word2
6. Read integer input → store as students
7. Consume remaining newline character
8. For i from 0 to students-1:
   a. Read next line
   b. Remove non-alphabetic characters, convert to lowercase → store as testCase
   c. If testCase equals any of perm1 through perm6:
        Print "ACC"
      Else:
        Print "WA"
9. End program
