Function signature: main(String[] args)
Required library: java.util.Scanner

Variables:
- Scanner sc (input scanner)
- int a (first input value)
- int b (second input value)
- int count (counter initialized to 0)
- int ans (result of calculation)

Execution flow:
1. Create Scanner object reading from System.in
2. Read integer input into variable a
3. Read integer input into variable b
4. Initialize count to 0
5. Enter while loop with condition true
6. Check if a > 0 AND b > 0
7. If condition true: increment count by 1, decrement a by 1, decrement b by 1
8. If condition false: break out of loop
9. Calculate ans = (a divided by 2) + (b divided by 2) using integer division
10. Print count followed by space followed by ans
