- Function: main
- Parameters: String[] args
- Return type: void
- Variables:
  - Scanner sc (input scanner)
  - int n (number of teams)
  - int result (counter initialized to 0)
  - int[] h (size n, home colors)
  - int[] g (size n, guest colors)
- Logic flow:
  1. Read integer n from input
  2. Initialize result to 0
  3. Create arrays h and g of size n
  4. For i from 0 to n-1:
     - Read h[i] from input
     - Read g[i] from input
  5. For i from 0 to n-1:
     - For j from 0 to n-1:
        - If h[i] equals g[j]:
           - Increment result by 1
  6. Print result
- Control structures:
  - Two nested for loops with range 0 to n-1
  - Conditional if statement comparing h[i] and g[j]
- Input/output:
  - Input: integer n followed by n pairs of integers
  - Output: single integer result
- Dependencies:
  - java.util.Scanner
