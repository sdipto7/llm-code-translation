**Function Signature:**
- `main(String[] args) throws IOException`

**Variables:**
- `sc: Scanner` (input scanner)
- `s: String[]` (split first input string)
- `t: String[]` (split second input string)
- `x: LocalTime` (constructed from s[0] and s[1])
- `y: LocalTime` (constructed from t[0] and t[1])

**Libraries/Dependencies:**
- `java.io.IOException`
- `java.time.LocalTime`
- `java.util.Scanner`

**Logic Flow:**
1. Create Scanner object reading from System.in
2. Read next token and split by ":" into array s
3. Read next token and split by ":" into array t
4. Parse s[0] to int for hours, s[1] to int for minutes
5. Construct LocalTime x from parsed hours and minutes
6. Parse t[0] to int for hours, t[1] to int for minutes
7. Construct LocalTime y from parsed hours and minutes
8. Subtract y's hours and minutes from x
9. Print resulting LocalTime
