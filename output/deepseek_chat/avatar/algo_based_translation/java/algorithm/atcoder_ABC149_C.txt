Algorithm:
- Import Scanner and Math libraries
- Declare public class atcoder_ABC149_C with main method taking String[] args parameter
- Create Scanner object stdIn reading from System.in
- Read next token from stdIn, parse to integer, assign to variable x (int)
- If x is not equal to 2 AND x modulo 2 equals 0, increment x by 1
- Begin infinite loop:
  - Declare variable i (int)
  - Calculate square root of x, assign to sqrtNum (double)
  - Initialize for loop with i = 3, condition i <= sqrtNum, increment i by 2:
    - If x modulo i equals 0, break out of for loop
  - After for loop, if i > sqrtNum, break out of infinite loop
  - Otherwise, increment x by 2
- Print value of x to standard output
