```python
Algorithm:
Function: main
Parameters: args (list of strings)
Return: void

Variables:
- sc: Scanner object for input
- n: integer (from input)
- m: integer (from input)

Logic Flow:
1. Create Scanner object to read from standard input
2. Read integer n from input
3. Read integer m from input
4. If n equals 0:
   - If m is not equal to 0: print "Impossible"
   - Else: print "0 0"
   - Return from function
5. If m is less than or equal to n:
   - If m equals 0: set m to 1
   - Print n followed by space followed by (m + n - 1)
   - Return from function
6. Otherwise: print m followed by space followed by (m + n - 1)

Required Libraries:
- java.io.*
- java.util.*
