**Function Signature:**
main(String[] args)

**Parameters:**
- args: String array

**Return Type:**
void

**Variables:**
- Scanner sc
- int n
- String s
- long rc = 0
- long gc = 0
- long bc = 0
- long result
- int i (loop counter)
- int k (loop counter)
- char is
- char ks
- char js

**Required Libraries:**
java.util.Scanner

**Algorithm Flow:**

1. Create Scanner object reading from System.in
2. Read integer n from input
3. Read string s from input
4. Initialize counters rc, gc, bc to 0
5. For each character in string s (index i from 0 to length-1):
   - If character is 'R': increment rc
   - Else if character is 'G': increment gc
   - Else: increment bc
6. Calculate result = rc * gc * bc
7. For i from 1 to n (inclusive):
   - For k from i+1 to n (inclusive):
     - If (i + k) is even:
       - Get character at position i-1 from s → is
       - Get character at position k-1 from s → ks
       - Get character at position ((i+k)/2)-1 from s → js
       - If is ≠ ks AND ks ≠ js AND js ≠ is:
         - Decrement result by 1
8. Print result
