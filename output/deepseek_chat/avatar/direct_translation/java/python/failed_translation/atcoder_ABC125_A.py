### Step 1: Understanding the Java Code

Before translating the Java code into Python, it's essential to understand what the Java code does. Here's a breakdown of the Java code:

1. **Import Statements**:
   java
   import java.util.* ;
   
   This imports all classes from the `java.util` package, which includes the `Scanner` class used for input.

2. **Class Definition**:
   java
   public class atcoder_ABC125_A {
   
   This defines a public class atcoder_ABC125_A {

3. **Main Method**:
   java
   public static void main(String[] args) {
   
   This is the main method where the execution of the program begins.

4. **Scanner Initialization**:
   java
   Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
   
   This initializes a `Scanner` object to read input from the standard input (keyboard).

5. **Reading Input Values**:
   java
   int sec = sc.nextInt();
   int per_num = sc.nextInt();
   
   These lines read two integers from the input:
   - `sec`: Represents the interval at which an operation is performed.
   - `per_num`: Represents the number of operations performed at each interval.

6. **Calculating Maximum Seconds**:
   java
   double max_sec = (double) sc.nextInt() + 0.5;
   
   This reads another integer from the input and converts it to a `double`, then adds `0.5` to it. This value represents the maximum time limit for the operation.

7. **Initializing the Counter**:
   java
   int ans_num = 0;
   
   This initializes a counter `ans_num` to zero, which will keep track of the total number of operations performed.

8. **Loop to Calculate Operations**:
   java
   for (int i = sec; i < max_sec; i += sec) {
       ans_num += per_num;
   }
   
   This loop starts at `sec` and increments by `sec` in each iteration until it reaches `max_sec`. In each iteration, `per_num` is added to `ans_num`.

9. **Printing the Result**:
   java
   System.out.println(ans_num);
   
   This prints the final value of `ans_num`.

10. **Closing the Main Method and Class**:
    java
    }
    }
    
    These close the main method and the class definition.

### Step 2: Translating Java Code to Python

Now that I understand the Java code, I'll translate it into Python. Since Python syntax is different from Java, I need to map each Java construct to its Python equivalent.

1. **Import Statements**:
   Java's `import java.util.*;` is not directly needed in Python. Python uses built-in functions for input.

2. **Class and Main Method**:
   Python doesn't require a main method or explicit class definition for simple scripts. However, for structure, I'll keep the class definition.

3. **Reading Input Values**:
   Java uses `Scanner` for input, while Python uses `input()` function.

4. **Data Handling**:
   Java has explicit types like `int` and `double`. Python is dynamically typed, but I'll use `int()` and `float()` for clarity.

5. **Loop Structure**:
   Java's `for` loop structure differs from Python's. I'll use Python's `for` loop with `range()`.

6. **Printing Output**:
   Java uses `System.out.println()`; Python uses `print()`.

Considering these points, here's the corresponding Python code:


class Atcoder_ABC125_A:
    @staticmethod
    def main():
        sec = int(input())
        per_num = int(input())
        max_sec = float(input()) + 0.5
        ans_num = 0
        current = sec
        while current < max_sec:
            ans_num += per_num
            current += sec
        print(ans_num)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Atcoder_ABC125_A.main()


**Explanation of the Python Code:**

1. **Class Definition**:
   
   class Atcoder_ABC125_A:
   
   Defines a class similar to the Java class.

2. **Static Method**:
   
   @staticmethod
   def main():
   
   Uses a static method to mimic Java's `main` method.

3. **Reading Input**:
   
   sec = int(input())
   per_num = int(input())
   max_sec = float(input()) + 0.5
   
   Reads integer and float inputs using `input()` and converts them appropriately.

4. **Initializing Counter**:
   
   ans_num = 0
   
   Initializes the counter variable.

5. **Loop Using While**:
   
   current = sec
   while current < max_sec:
       ans_num += per_num
       current += sec
   
   Uses a `while` loop to iterate until `current` exceeds `max_sec`. Adds `per_num` to `ans_num` on each iteration.

6. **Printing Result**:
   
   print(ans_num)
   
   Outputs the final value of `ans_num`.

7. **Running the Main Method**:
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       Atcoder_ABC125_A.main()
   
   Ensures the `main()` method runs when the script is executed directly.

### Step 3: Verifying the Python Code

To ensure the Python code functions as intended, I'll walk through an example:

**Java Input:**

3
5
10


**Java Output:**

15


**Python Execution:**
- `sec = 3`
- `per_num = 5`
- `max_sec = 10.5`
- Loop iterations:
  - Current = 3 (3 < 10.5): `ans_num = 5`
  - Current = 6 (6 < 10.5): `ans_num = 10`
  - Current = 9 (9 < 10.5): `ans_num = 15`
  - Current = 12 (12 > 10.5): Exit loop
- Output: `15`

The Python code produces the same output as the Java code for the given input, confirming its correctness.

### Step 4: Final Python Code

After verification, here's the final Python code without any comments or headers:


class Atcoder_ABC125_A:
    @staticmethod
    def main():
        sec = int(input())
        per_num = int(input())
        max_sec = float(input()) + 0.5
        ans_num = 0
        current = sec
        while current < max_sec:
            ans_num += per_num
            current += sec
        print(ans_num)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Atcoder_ABC125_A.main()


This Python code accurately translates the functionality of the original Java code, adhering to Python's syntax and conventions.
