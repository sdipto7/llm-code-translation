# 1. **Understanding the Python Code:**

# The provided Python code defines a function `main` that performs the following tasks:
# - Accepts an integer input `K`.
# - Accepts a string input `S`.
# - Checks if the length of the string `S` is less than or equal to `K`.
#   - If true, it returns the string `S` as is.
#   - If false, it returns a truncated version of `S` consisting of the first `K` characters followed by `'...'`.
# - The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block ensures that the `main` function is executed when the script is run directly.

# 2. **Planning the Java Translation:**

# To translate this Python code into Java, we need to:
# - Write a `main` method in a class.
# - Use `Scanner` to accept user input for `K` and `S`.
# - Implement the logic to check the length of `S` and return the appropriate string.
# - Print the result.

# 3. **Writing the Java Code:**

# Here's the Java code that corresponds to the given Python code:


import java.util.Scanner;

public class atcoder_ABC168_B {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int K = scanner.nextInt();
        // Consume the remaining newline character
        scanner.nextLine();
        String S = scanner.nextLine();
        if (S.length() <= K) {
            System.out.println(S);
        } else {
            System.out.println(S.substring(0, K) + "...");
        }
    }
}


# 4. **Explanation of the Java Code:**

# - **Class Declaration:** The class is named `Main`, which is a common name for the main class in Java applications.
# - **Main Method:** The `public static void main(String[] args)` method is the entry point of the Java program.
# - **Scanner Object:** A `Scanner` object is created to read input from the standard input stream (`System.in`).

# - **Reading Inputs:**
#   - `int K = scanner.nextInt();` reads the integer `K`.
#   - `scanner.nextLine();` consumes the remaining newline character after the integer input.
#   - `String S = scanner.nextLine();` reads the string `S`.

# - **Logic Implementation:**
#   - The `if (S.length() <= K)` condition checks if the length of `S` is less than or equal to `K`.
#     - If true, it prints `S` directly.
#     - If false, it prints the substring of `S` from the start to the `K`th character, concatenated with `"..."`.

# - **Output:** The result is printed using `System.out.println`.

# 5. **Additional Considerations:**

# - **Input Constraints:** Ensure that the input provided to `scanner.nextInt()` is a valid integer, and `scanner.nextLine()` captures the correct string without leading or trailing spaces.
# - **Edge Cases:** Consider cases where `K` is zero, negative, or larger than the length of `S` to ensure the program behaves as expected.

# 6. **Final Thoughts:**

# Translating code between Python and Java involves understanding the syntax and standard libraries of both languages. The core logic remains the same, but the way inputs are handled and outputs are displayed can differ. This Java implementation accurately mirrors the functionality of the original Python script.
