Function Signature:
- main(String[] args): void

Variable Declarations:
- sec: int
- per_num: int
- max_sec: double
- ans_num: int
- i: int

Libraries/Modules:
- java.util.Scanner

Execution Order:
1. Create a Scanner object to read input from System.in.
2. Read an integer value and assign it to sec.
3. Read an integer value and assign it to per_num.
4. Read an integer value, convert it to double, add 0.5, and assign it to max_sec.
5. Initialize ans_num to 0.
6. For loop starts with i initialized to sec, continues while i is less than max_sec, increments i by sec in each iteration:
   - Add per_num to ans_num.
7. Print the value of ans_num.
