Function signature: main(String[] args) - No return type

Variable declarations:
- Scanner ob - for input operations
- int n - number of elements in the array
- int[] array - array to store integers with size n+1
- int odd - counter for odd numbers
- int even - counter for even numbers
- int odd_ind - index of the last odd number found
- int even_ind - index of the last even number found

Logic flow and control structures:

1. Create a Scanner object to read input
2. Read integer n from input
3. Initialize array of size n+1
4. Loop from 1 to n (inclusive):
   - Read integer from input and store it in array[i]
5. Initialize odd, even, odd_ind, even_ind to 0
6. Loop from 1 to n (inclusive):
   - If array[i] is even:
     - Increment even counter
     - Set even_ind to current index i
   - Else:
     - Increment odd counter
     - Set odd_ind to current index i
7. If odd counter is greater than even counter:
   - Print even_ind
   - Else:
     - Print odd_ind

Input/output operations:
- Read integer n from standard input
- Read n integers from standard input and store in array
- Print either even_ind or odd_ind based on comparison of odd and even counters

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- java.util.Scanner
