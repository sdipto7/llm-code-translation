Function Signatures:
- main(String[] args): void
- solve(int testNumber, Scanner in, PrintWriter out): void

Variable Declarations:
- InputStream inputStream: InputStream
- OutputStream outputStream: OutputStream
- Scanner in: Scanner
- PrintWriter out: PrintWriter
- BABC solver: BABC
- String s: String
- long cnt: long
- long tmp: long
- int i: int

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize inputStream to System.in
2. Initialize outputStream to System.out
3. Create a Scanner object in with inputStream
4. Create a PrintWriter object out with outputStream
5. Create a BABC object solver
6. Call solver.solve with 1, in, and out
7. Close out

Within solve:
1. Read a string from in and replace all occurrences of "BC" with "D", store in s
2. Initialize cnt to 0
3. Initialize tmp to 0
4. For each character in s from index 0 to s.length() - 1:
   a. If character is 'A':
      i. Increment tmp by 1
   b. Else if character is 'D':
      i. Add tmp to cnt
   c. Else:
      i. Set tmp to 0
5. Print cnt using out
