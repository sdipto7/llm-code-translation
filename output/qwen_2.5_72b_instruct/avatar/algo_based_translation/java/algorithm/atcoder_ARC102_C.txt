Function signatures with parameter and return types:
- `main(String[] args)`: void

Variable declarations and data types:
- `mod`: int
- `nchoosek`: long[][]
- `sc`: Scanner
- `k`: int
- `n`: int
- `i`: int
- `pairs`: int
- `active`: int
- `times2`: long
- `total`: long
- `j`: int
- `choice`: long

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Initialize `mod` to 998244353
2. Initialize `nchoosek` as a 4001x4001 long array
3. Set `nchoosek[i][0]` and `nchoosek[i][i]` to 1 for all i from 0 to 4000
4. For i from 2 to 4000:
    - For j from 1 to i-1:
        - Calculate `nchoosek[i][j]` as `(nchoosek[i-1][j] + nchoosek[i-1][j-1]) % mod`
5. Create a Scanner object `sc`
6. Read `k` as an integer from the input
7. Read `n` as an integer from the input
8. For i from 2 to 2*k:
    - If i > k, set `pairs` to `k - i / 2`, otherwise set `pairs` to `(i - 1) / 2`
    - Set `active` to `k - 2 * pairs`
    - If i is even, decrement `active` by 1
    - Initialize `times2` to 1
    - Initialize `total` to 0
    - For j from 0 to pairs:
        - Calculate `choice` as `times2 * nchoosek[pairs][j] % mod`
        - Update `times2` to `times2 * 2 % mod`
        - If `active + j - 1` is less than 0, continue to next iteration
        - Add `choice * nchoosek[n + active - 1][active + j - 1]` to `total`
        - If i is even, add `choice * nchoosek[n + active - 2][active + j - 1]` to `total`
        - Update `total` to `total % mod`
9. Print `total`

Control structures:
- For loops: 
    - From 0 to 4000 for initializing `nchoosek`
    - From 2 to 4000 for filling `nchoosek`
    - From 1 to i-1 for filling `nchoosek`
    - From 2 to 2*k for main calculations
    - From 0 to pairs for inner calculations
- If-else statements:
    - To determine `pairs` based on the value of `i`
    - To adjust `active` if `i` is even
    - To skip iterations where `active + j - 1` is less than 0

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read integers `k` and `n` from standard input
- Output: Print the final value of `total` to standard output

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `java.util.Scanner`
