Function signatures:
- main(String[] args): void

Variable declarations and data types:
- Scanner sc: for input reading
- int n: number of elements in the array
- int k: number of queries
- int[] arr: array to store input numbers
- StringBuffer res: to accumulate results
- int o: count of odd numbers in arr
- int e: count of even numbers in arr
- int l: left index of each query
- int r: right index of each query

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Initialize Scanner object for input reading
2. Read n and k from input
3. Initialize array arr of size n
4. Read n integers from input into arr
5. Initialize StringBuffer res to accumulate results
6. Initialize counters o and e to zero
7. Loop through arr to count odd and even numbers:
   - If arr[i] == 1, increment o
   - Else, increment e
8. Loop k times for each query:
   - Read l and r for each query
   - If (r - l + 1) % 2 == 1:
     - Append "0\n" to res
   - Else:
     - If (r - l + 1) / 2 <= o and (r - l + 1) / 2 <= e:
       - Append "1\n" to res
     - Else:
       - Append "0\n" to res
9. Print res
10. Close Scanner object

Control structures:
- For loop to read array elements
- For loop to process each query
- If-else conditions to determine the result for each query

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Read integers from input using Scanner
- Store integers in array arr
- Count odd and even numbers in arr
- For each query, determine if the subarray can be split into two equal parts with equal counts of odd and even numbers
- Accumulate results in StringBuffer res
- Print final results

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- java.io.IOException
- java.util.Scanner
