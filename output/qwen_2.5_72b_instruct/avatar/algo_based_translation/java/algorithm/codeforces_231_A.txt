Function Signature: public static void main(String[] args)

Variable Declarations:
- Scanner sc
- int t
- int count initialized to 0
- int a
- int b
- int c

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize Scanner object sc to read input from System.in
2. Read integer t from sc
3. Set count to 0
4. While t is greater than 0:
   - Decrement t by 1
   - Read integer a from sc
   - Read integer b from sc
   - Read integer c from sc
   - If (a == 1 && b == 1) || (a == 1 && c == 1) || (b == 1 && c == 1) || (a == 1 && b == 1 && c == 1):
     - Increment count by 1
5. Print count

Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- java.util.Scanner
