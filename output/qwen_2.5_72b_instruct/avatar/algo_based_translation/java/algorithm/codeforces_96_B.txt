Function signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `Scanner in` as `Scanner`
- `long number` as `long`
- `long ans` as `long`
- `long value` as `long`
- `int mask` as `int`
- `String s` as `String`
- `int zeros` as `int`
- `char c` as `char`

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Create a `Scanner` object named `in` to read input from `System.in`.
2. Read a `long` value from `in` and store it in `number`.
3. Initialize `ans` to `-1`.
4. Initialize `value` to `0`.
5. Initialize `mask` to `2`.
6. Enter a `while` loop that continues as long as `value` is less than `number`.
7. Convert `mask` to a binary string, remove the first character, and store it in `s`.
8. Initialize `zeros` to `0`.
9. Iterate over each character `c` in `s`:
   - If `c` is `'0'`, increment `zeros`.
10. If `zeros` is not equal to the length of `s` minus `zeros`, continue to the next iteration of the loop.
11. Replace all `'0'` characters in `s` with `'4'`.
12. Replace all `'1'` characters in `s` with `'7'`.
13. Convert the modified `s` to a `long` and store it in `value`.
14. After exiting the loop, print `value`.
