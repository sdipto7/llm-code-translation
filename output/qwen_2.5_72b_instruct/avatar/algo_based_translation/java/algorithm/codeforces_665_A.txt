Function signature:
- main(String[] args) throws IOException

Variable declarations and data types:
- BufferedReader br
- PrintWriter pw
- StringTokenizer st
- int a
- int tA
- int b
- int tB
- String timing
- int hrs
- int mins
- int simDeparture
- int simArrival
- int counter
- int i
- int busDeparture
- int busArrival

Logic flow and control structures:
1. Initialize BufferedReader for reading input and PrintWriter for output.
2. Read the first line and tokenize it. Parse the first token as int a and the second as int tA.
3. Read the second line and tokenize it. Parse the first token as int b and the second as int tB.
4. Read the third line as String timing.
5. Parse the first two characters of timing as int hrs and the last two characters as int mins.
6. Calculate simDeparture as hrs * 60 + mins.
7. Calculate simArrival as simDeparture + tA.
8. Initialize counter to 0.
9. For i from 300 to 1439 inclusive, incrementing by b:
   - Set busDeparture to i.
   - Set busArrival to i + tB.
   - If busDeparture is greater than or equal to simArrival or simDeparture is greater than or equal to busArrival, continue to next iteration.
   - Increment counter by 1.
10. Print the value of counter.
11. Flush and close PrintWriter.

Input/output operations:
- Read three lines of input from standard input.
- Output a single integer to standard output.

Data processing logic:
- Convert time from HH:MM format to minutes since midnight.
- Calculate the departure and arrival times of the simulation.
- Check for overlapping time intervals between the simulation and bus schedules.
- Count the number of bus schedules that overlap with the simulation time.

Libraries/modules/dependencies:
- java.io.BufferedReader
