- Function signatures:
  - `public static void main(String[] args)`
  - `public void run()`

- Variable declarations and data types:
  - `atcoder_ABC128_C main`
  - `Scanner sc`
  - `int N`
  - `int M`
  - `ArrayList<Integer> a`
  - `int k`
  - `int s`
  - `int p`
  - `int ans`
  - `int t`

- Logic flow in execution order:
  - Create an instance of `atcoder_ABC128_C` and call `run()`
  - Initialize `Scanner sc` for reading input
  - Read `N` and `M` as integers
  - Initialize `ArrayList<Integer> a` with `N` elements all set to 0
  - Loop `M` times to read switch configurations:
    - Read `k` as the number of switches for the current configuration
    - Loop `k` times to read switch indices `s` and update `a` at index `s-1` by setting the `i`th bit
  - Read `M` integers and combine them into a single integer `p` where each bit represents a light's required state
  - Initialize `ans` to 0 to count valid switch combinations
  - Loop from `0` to `2^N - 1` to represent all possible switch states:
    - Initialize `t` to 0 to compute the state of lights for the current switch configuration
    - Loop `N` times to check each switch:
      - If the `i`th bit of the current switch state is set, update `t` by XORing it with the value at index `i` in `a`
    - If `t` equals `p`, increment `ans`
  - Print `ans` as the result
  - Close `sc` to free resources
