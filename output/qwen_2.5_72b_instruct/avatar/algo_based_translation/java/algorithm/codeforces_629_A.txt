Function signature: main(String[] args)

Variable declarations and data types:
- Scanner sc
- int num
- int counter
- int fine
- ArrayList<String> arr

Logic flow:
1. Initialize Scanner sc to read input from System.in
2. Read integer num from input
3. Initialize counter to 0
4. Initialize fine to 0
5. Initialize empty ArrayList<String> arr
6. For i from 0 to num - 1:
   - Read string s from input
   - Add s to arr
7. For i from 0 to num - 1:
   - For k from 0 to num - 1:
      - If character at position i in string at position k in arr is 'C':
         - Increment counter by 1
   - Add (counter * (counter - 1)) / 2 to fine
   - Reset counter to 0
8. For i from 0 to num - 1:
   - For k from 0 to num - 1:
      - If character at position k in string at position i in arr is 'C':
         - Increment counter by 1
   - Add (counter * (counter - 1)) / 2 to fine
   - Reset counter to 0
9. Print fine

Required libraries:
- java.util.Scanner
- java.util.ArrayList
