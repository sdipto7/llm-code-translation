Function signature:
- main(String[]): void

Variable declarations and data types:
- Scanner in: new Scanner(System.in)
- int n: integer input from user
- int[] a: array of integers of size n
- int[] b: array of integers of size n, initialized to 0
- int s: integer initialized to -1
- int tem: integer initialized to 1
- int q: integer initialized to 0

Logic flow in execution order:
- Read integer n from input
- Initialize array a of size n
- Initialize array b of size n with 0 values
- Initialize s to -1
- Initialize tem to 1
- Initialize q to 0
- While there are more inputs:
    - Increment s by 1
    - If tem equals 1:
        - For i from 0 to n-1:
            - If a[i] is less than or equal to q and b[i] is 0:
                - Set b[i] to 1
                - Increment q by 1
        - Set tem to 0
    - Else:
        - For i from n-1 to 0:
            - If a[i] is less than or equal to q and b[i] is 0:
                - Set b[i] to 1
                - Increment q by 1
        - Set tem to 1
- Print value of s

Control structures:
- While loop: while (in.hasNext())
- For loop: for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
- For loop: for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--)
- If condition: if (tem == 1)
- If condition: if (a[i] <= q && b[i] == 0)

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read integer n and then n integers for array a
- Output: Print integer s after processing all inputs

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- java.util.*
