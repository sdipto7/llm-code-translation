Function signatures with parameter and return types:
- `main(String[] args) : void`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `n : int`
- `m : int`
- `a[] : int`
- `input : Scanner`
- `sub : int`
- `test : int`
- `count : int`
- `i : int`

Complete logic flow in execution order:

1. Initialize `input` as a new `Scanner` object for reading input from the standard input stream.
2. Read an integer value from the input and assign it to `n`.
3. Read an integer value from the input and assign it to `m`.
4. Declare an integer array `a` of size `m`.
5. If `n` modulo `m` is equal to 0:
   - Loop from `0` to `m-1` (inclusive):
     - Assign `n` divided by `m` to `a[i]`.
6. Otherwise:
   - Assign `n` divided by `m` to `sub`.
   - Loop from `0` to `m-1` (inclusive):
     - Assign `sub` to `a[i]`.
   - Assign `n` minus the result of `sub` multiplied by `m` to `test`.
   - Initialize `count` to `0`.
   - Loop from `0` to `test-1` (inclusive):
     - Increment `a[count]` by `1`.
     - Increment `count` by `1`.
     - If `count` is greater than `a.length`, assign `0` to `count`.
7. Loop from `m-1` to `0` (inclusive):
   - Print the value of `a[i]` followed by a space.
