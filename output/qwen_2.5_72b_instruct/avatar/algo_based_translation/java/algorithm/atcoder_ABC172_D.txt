Function signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `Scanner sc` of type `Scanner`
- `int n` of type `int`
- `long ans` of type `long`
- `int i` of type `int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Create a new `Scanner` object `sc` to read input from `System.in`.
2. Read an integer `n` from the input.
3. Initialize `ans` to 0.
4. Start a `for` loop with `i` initialized to 1; continue while `i` is less than `n + 1`; increment `i` by 1 in each iteration:
   - Calculate `(long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2` and add the result to `ans`.
5. Print the value of `ans`.

Control structures:
- `for` loop with condition `i < n + 1`

Input/output operations:
- Read an integer `n` from the standard input.
- Print the final value of `ans` to the standard output.

Data processing logic:
- For each `i` from 1 to `n`, compute the sum of products of `i` and the number of multiples of `i` up to `n`, add this to `ans`.

Required libraries/modules/dependencies:
- `java.util.Scanner`
