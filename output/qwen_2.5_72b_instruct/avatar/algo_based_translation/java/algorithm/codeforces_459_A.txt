Function signature:
- main(String[] args): void

Variable declarations and data types:
- Scanner in
- PrintWriter pw
- int x1
- int y1
- int x2
- int y2
- int dif

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Initialize Scanner in to read from System.in
2. Initialize PrintWriter pw to write to System.out
3. Read four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 from input
4. If x1 equals x2:
   a. Calculate dif as the absolute difference between y1 and y2
   b. Print (x1 + dif), y1, (x1 + dif), y2
5. Else if y1 equals y2:
   a. Calculate dif as the absolute difference between x1 and x2
   b. Print x1, (y1 + dif), x2, (y2 + dif)
6. Else if the absolute difference between x1 and x2 equals the absolute difference between y1 and y2:
   a. Print x1, y2, x2, y1
7. Else:
   a. Print -1
8. Close PrintWriter pw

Control structures:
- If statement with condition x1 == x2
- Else if statement with condition y1 == y2
- Else if statement with condition Math.abs(x1 - x2) == Math.abs(y1 - y2)
- Else statement

Input/output operations:
- Read four integers from standard input
- Print four integers or -1 to standard output

Data processing logic:
- Calculate absolute differences for conditions
- Determine the appropriate output based on coordinate relationships

Required libraries/modules/dependencies:
- java.io.*
- java.util.*
