Function Signature: 
- `main(String[] args)`: void

Variable Declarations:
- `Scanner sc`: Scanner
- `String str`: String
- `char[] c`: char array
- `long k`: long
- `int n`: int
- `int i`: int

Logic Flow:
1. Create a new Scanner object to read input.
2. Read a string from the input and store it in `str`.
3. Convert `str` to a character array `c`.
4. Read a long integer from the input and store it in `k`.
5. Determine the length of `str` and store it in `n`.
6. Initialize a for loop with `i` starting at 0, incrementing by 1, and continuing as long as `i` is less than `k`.
7. Inside the loop, check if the character at index `i` of `c` is '1'.
   - If true, check if `i` is equal to `k - 1`.
     - If true, print 1 and return from the main function.
8. If the character at index `i` of `c` is not '1'.
   - Print the character at index `i` of `c` and return from the main function.

Libraries:
- `java.util.Scanner`
