FastReader class:
- Constructor: initializes BufferedReader and StringTokenizer
- next(): reads next token from input, returns as String
- nextInt(): converts next token to int
- nextLong(): converts next token to long
- nextDouble(): converts next token to double
- nextLine(): reads next line from input, returns as String

Function signatures:
- main(String[] args): void
- solve(): void

Variable declarations and data types:
- t: int
- arr: int[]
- prevWinner: int
- i: int

Logic flow in execution order:
- Initialize FastReader object scan
- Read number of test cases t (always 1 in this code)
- While t > 0:
    - Read integer t (number of elements in array)
    - Initialize array arr of size t
    - For i from 0 to t-1:
        - Read integer and store in arr[i]
    - Initialize prevWinner to 0
    - For i from 0 to t-1:
        - If arr[i] == 1:
            - If prevWinner == 0:
                - Set prevWinner to 2
        - If prevWinner == 2 or prevWinner == 0:
            - If (arr[i] - 1) % 2 == 0:
                - Print 2
                - Set prevWinner to 2
            - Else:
                - Print 1
                - Set prevWinner to 1
        - Else:
            - If (arr[i] - 1) % 2 == 0:
                - Print 1
                - Set prevWinner to 1
            - Else:
                - Print 2
                - Set prevWinner to 2

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Reads integers from standard input using FastReader
- Processes the array based on the rules defined in the solve() function
- Prints 1 or 2 for each element in the array based on conditions

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- java.util.*
- java.io.*
