Function signature:
- main(String[] args) throws IOException

Variable declarations and data types:
- Scanner sc
- String[] s
- String[] t
- LocalTime x
- LocalTime y

Execution order and logic flow:
- Create a Scanner object to read input from standard input
- Read the first input string, split it by ":" into array s
- Read the second input string, split it by ":" into array t
- Convert the first element of s to an integer, use it as the hour, and the second element to an integer, use it as the minute to create a LocalTime object x
- Convert the first element of t to an integer, use it as the hour, and the second element to an integer, use it as the minute to create a LocalTime object y
- Subtract the hour and minute of y from x
- Print the result of the subtraction

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Two strings representing times in HH:MM format
- Processing: Convert strings to LocalTime objects, perform time subtraction
- Output: Resulting LocalTime after subtraction

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- java.io.IOException
- java.time.LocalTime
- java.util.Scanner
