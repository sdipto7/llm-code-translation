Function signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`

Variable declarations:
- `Scanner sc` of type `Scanner`
- `int N`
- `int D`
- `int[][] vectors` of size `[N][D]`
- `int answer` initialized to `0`
- `int dist` initialized to `0`
- `int x`
- `double sq`
- `int i` loop variable
- `int j` loop variable
- `int d` loop variable

Logic flow:
1. Create a `Scanner` object `sc` for reading input.
2. Read an integer `N` representing the number of vectors.
3. Read an integer `D` representing the dimension of each vector.
4. Declare a 2D array `vectors` of size `N x D` to store the vectors.
5. For `i` from `0` to `N-1`:
   - For `j` from `0` to `D-1`:
     - Read an integer and store it in `vectors[i][j]`.
6. Initialize `answer` to `0` to count the number of integer distances.
7. For `i` from `0` to `N-2`:
   - For `j` from `i+1` to `N-1`:
     - Initialize `dist` to `0` to accumulate the squared distance.
     - For `d` from `0` to `D-1`:
       - Calculate the difference `x` between the `d`-th component of `vectors[i]` and `vectors[j]`.
       - Add `x * x` to `dist`.
     - Calculate the square root of `dist` and store it in `sq`.
     - If the absolute difference between `sq` and its floor value is less than `0.001`, increment `answer`.
8. Print the value of `answer`.
