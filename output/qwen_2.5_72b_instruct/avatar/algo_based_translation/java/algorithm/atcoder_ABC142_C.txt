Function signatures with parameter and return types:
- `main(String[] args): void`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `scanner: Scanner`
- `N: int`
- `idorder: Map<Integer, Integer>`
- `i: int`
- `A: int`

Complete logic flow in execution order:
- Create a `Scanner` object to read input.
- Read an integer `N` from the input.
- Initialize a `HashMap` called `idorder` to store mappings from integers to their order.
- Loop from 1 to `N` (inclusive):
  - Read an integer `A` from the input.
  - Insert the mapping of `A` to the current loop index `i` in the `idorder` map.
- Loop from 1 to `N` (inclusive):
  - Retrieve the value from `idorder` map for the key equal to the current loop index `i`.
  - Print the retrieved value followed by a space.

Control structures:
- For loop from 1 to `N` (inclusive) for reading and storing input values.
- For loop from 1 to `N` (inclusive) for printing the order of integers.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Read an integer `N` to determine the number of elements.
- Read `N` integers and map each integer to its order of appearance.
- Print the order of integers from 1 to `N` based on the stored mappings.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `java.util.*` for using `Scanner`, `Map`, and `HashMap`.
