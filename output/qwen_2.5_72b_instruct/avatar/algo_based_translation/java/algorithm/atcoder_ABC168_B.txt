Function signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`
Variable declarations: 
- `Scanner in` of type `Scanner`
- `int K` of type `int`
- `String S` of type `String`
Logic flow:
1. Create an instance of `Scanner` and assign it to `in`
2. Read an integer from input and assign it to `K`
3. Read a string from input and assign it to `S`
4. If the length of `S` is less than or equal to `K`
   - Print `S`
5. Else
   - Print the substring of `S` from index `0` to `K` (exclusive) concatenated with `"..."`
