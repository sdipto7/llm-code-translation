Function signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`
Variable declarations:
- `Scanner scanner` of type `Scanner`
- `long n` of type `long`
- `int sqrt` of type `int`
- `int answer` of type `int`
- `int i` of type `int`
- `int count` of type `int`
- `int j` of type `int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Create a `Scanner` object to read input from `System.in`.
2. Read a `long` value from input and assign it to `n`.
3. Calculate the square root of `n` and cast it to `int`, assigning it to `sqrt`.
4. Initialize `answer` to 0.
5. For loop starting with `i = 2` and incrementing `i` by 1 until `i` is greater than `sqrt`:
   1. Initialize `count` to 0.
   2. While loop checking if `n % i` equals 0:
      1. Divide `n` by `i` and assign the result back to `n`.
      2. Increment `count` by 1.
   3. For loop starting with `j = 1` and incrementing `j` by 1 until `count - j` is less than 0:
      1. Subtract `j` from `count`.
      2. Increment `answer` by 1.
6. If `n` is greater than 1, increment `answer` by 1.
7. Print the value of `answer`.
