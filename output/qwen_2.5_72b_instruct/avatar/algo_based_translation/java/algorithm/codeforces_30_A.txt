Function signatures with parameter and return types:
- main(String[]): void
- solve(Scanner): void

Variable declarations and data types:
- A: int
- B: int
- n: int
- neg: boolean
- x: int

Complete logic flow in execution order:

1. Create a new instance of codeforces_30_A and call solve with a new Scanner for System.in.
2. In solve:
   - Read three integers A, B, and n from the scanner.
   - If A is 0:
     - If B is 0, print 1 and return.
     - Otherwise, print "No solution" and return.
   - If B modulo A is not 0, print "No solution" and return.
   - Divide B by A.
   - Set neg to true if B is less than 0, otherwise false.
   - If neg is true and n modulo 2 is 0, print "No solution" and return.
   - If neg is true, set B to -B.
   - For x from 0 to B (inclusive):
     - If x to the power of n equals B, print -x if neg is true, otherwise print x, and return.
   - Print "No solution".
