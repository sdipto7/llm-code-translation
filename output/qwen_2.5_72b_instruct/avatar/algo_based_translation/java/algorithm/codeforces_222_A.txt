Function signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `Scanner in` as `Scanner`
- `int n` as `int`
- `int k` as `int`
- `int l` as `int` initialized to `0`
- `int c` as `int` initialized to `1`
- `int a` as `int` inside the for loop

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Create a `Scanner` object named `in` to read input.
2. Read two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
3. Initialize `l` to `0` and `c` to `1`.
4. Loop from `0` to `n-1`:
   1. Read an integer `a` from the input.
   2. Check if `a` is equal to `l`:
      - If true, increment `c` by `1`.
      - If false, set `c` to `1`.
   3. Set `l` to `a`.
5. Check if `c + k` is greater than `n`:
   - If true, print `n - c`.
   - If false, print `-1`.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `n` integers.
- Output: A single integer, either `n - c` or `-1` based on the condition.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `java.util.Scanner`
