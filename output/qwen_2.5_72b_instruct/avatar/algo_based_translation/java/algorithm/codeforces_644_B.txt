Function Signature:
- main(String[] args): void

Variable Declarations:
- n: int
- b: int
- ans: long[]
- q: LinkedList<Long>
- i: int (loop variable)
- t: int
- d: int

Logic Flow:
- Initialize Scanner for input
- Read n and b from input
- Initialize ans array of size n with type long
- Initialize LinkedList q for Long type
- For i from 0 to n-1:
    - Read t and d from input
    - While q is not empty and the first element of q is less than or equal to t:
        - Remove the first element from q
    - If the size of q is less than or equal to b:
        - If q is empty:
            - Set ans[i] to t + d
        - Else:
            - Set ans[i] to the last element of q + d
        - Add ans[i] to q
    - Else:
        - Set ans[i] to -1
- For i from 0 to n-1:
    - Print ans[i] followed by a space
