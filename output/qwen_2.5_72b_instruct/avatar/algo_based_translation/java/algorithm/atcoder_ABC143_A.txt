Function signature:
- `public static void main(String[] args)`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `BufferedReader bf`
- `String[] x`
- `int a`
- `int b`
- `int c`

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Create `BufferedReader` object `bf` for reading input from standard input.
2. Read a line of input using `bf.readLine()`, trim any leading/trailing whitespace, and split the string by spaces into `x`.
3. Parse the first element of `x` as an integer and assign it to `a`.
4. Parse the second element of `x` as an integer and assign it to `b`.
5. Calculate `c` as `a - b * 2`.
6. If `c` is less than 0, set `c` to 0.
7. Print the value of `c`.

Control structures:
- `if (c < 0)` then `c = 0`

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input.
- Processing: Computes the difference between the first integer and twice the second integer, ensuring the result is non-negative.
- Output: Prints the computed non-negative difference.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `java.io.BufferedReader`
- `java.io.InputStreamReader`
- `java.util.Scanner` (not used in the code but imported)
