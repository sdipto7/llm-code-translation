Function signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `Scanner in` as `Scanner`
- `int n` as `int`
- `int d` as `int`
- `int[] nums` as `int[]`
- `int result` as `int`
- `int a` as `int`
- `int i` as `int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Create a new `Scanner` object named `in` to read input from `System.in`.
2. Read an integer from `in` and assign it to `n`.
3. Read another integer from `in` and assign it to `d`.
4. Initialize an array `nums` of size `n`.
5. For `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
   - Read an integer from `in` and assign it to `nums[i]`.
6. Initialize `result` to `0`.
7. Initialize `a` to `0`.
8. For `i` from `1` to `n-1`:
   - Assign `(nums[i-1] - nums[i])` to `a`.
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `0`:
     - Add `a / d + 1` to `result`.
     - Add `(a / d + 1) * d` to `nums[i]`.
9. Print `result` to the standard output.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Reads integers from the standard input using `Scanner`.
- Processes the integers to determine a result based on differences between consecutive elements and division by `d`.
- Outputs the final result as an integer to the standard output.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `java.util.Scanner`
