Function signature: `main(String[] args)`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `N` as `int`
- `map` as `HashMap<Integer, Integer>`
- `nums` as `PriorityQueue<Integer>`
- `tmp` as `int`
- `bin` as `int` initialized to `0`
- `diff` as `int` initialized to `0`
- `num` as `int`
- `idx` as `int`
- `ans` as `int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Create a `Scanner` object to read input.
2. Read integer `N`.
3. Initialize `map` to store integers and their indices.
4. Initialize `nums` as a priority queue to store integers.
5. Loop from `0` to `N-1`:
   - Read integer `tmp`.
   - Add `tmp` to `nums`.
   - Put `tmp` and its index `i` into `map`.
6. While `nums` is not empty:
   - Poll `num` from `nums`.
   - Get `idx` from `map` using `num`.
   - If `(bin % 2) != (idx % 2)`, increment `diff`.
   - Increment `bin`.
   - Set `bin` to `bin % 2`.
7. Calculate `ans` as `diff / 2`.
8. Print `ans`.

Control structures:
- `for` loop from `0` to `N-1`.
- `while` loop until `nums` is empty.
- `if` statement checking `(bin % 2) != (idx % 2)`.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Read integer `N`.
- Read `N` integers and store them in `nums` and their indices in `map`.
- Process each integer in sorted order from `nums`.
- Count mismatches between the binary index `bin` and the original index `idx`.
- Calculate and print half the count of mismatches.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `java.util.*` for `Scanner`, `HashMap`, and `PriorityQueue`.
