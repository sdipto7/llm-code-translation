Function signature: main(String[] hi)
Parameters: String[] hi
Return type: void

Variable declarations and data types:
BufferedReader infile: for reading input from standard input
char[] arr: to store characters of the first input line
int N: to store the length of arr
HashSet<String> set: for storing unique strings (unused)
int K: to store the number of queries
int res: to store the final result
String input: to store each query string
int a: to count occurrences of the first character in the query
int b: to count occurrences of the second character in the query
int i: loop index for iterating over arr
int k: loop index for iterating over the number of queries

Execution order and logic flow:

1. Initialize infile with a BufferedReader reading from standard input
2. Read the first line and convert it to a char array arr
3. Set N to the length of arr
4. Initialize set as a new HashSet (unused in the logic)
5. Read the next line and parse it as an integer K
6. Initialize res to 0
7. For each query (k from 0 to K-1):
   a. Read the next line and store it in input
   b. Initialize a and b to 0
   c. For each character in arr (i from 0 to N-1):
      i. If the character matches the first character of input, increment a
      ii. Else if the character matches the second character of input, increment b
      iii. Else:
          1. Add the minimum value between a and b to res
          2. Reset a and b to 0
   d. After the inner loop, add the minimum value between a and b to res
8. Print the value of res to standard output
