Function signature: main function with parameter types (String[] args) and return type void

Variable declarations:
- n of type int
- arr of type char[][]
- str of type String[]
- a of type char
- b of type char
- res of type boolean

Logic flow:
1. Initialize Scanner object sc
2. Read integer n from input
3. Create 2D character array arr of size n x n
4. Create 1D String array str of size n
5. For i from 0 to n-1 (inclusive):
   - Read string from input and store in str[i]
6. For i from 0 to n-1 (inclusive):
   - For j from 0 to n-1 (inclusive):
       - Set arr[i][j] to character at index j of str[i]
7. Set a to arr[0][0]
8. Set b to arr[0][1]
9. If a equals b:
   - Print "NO"
10. Else:
    - Set res to true
    - For i from 0 to n-1 (inclusive):
        - For j from 0 to n-1 (inclusive):
            - If i equals j or i + j equals n - 1:
                - If arr[i][j] does not equal a:
                    - Set res to false
                    - Break out of inner loop
            - Else:
                - If arr[i][j] does not equal b:
                    - Set res to false
                    - Break out of inner loop
    - If res:
        - Print "YES"
    - Else:
        - Print "NO"
