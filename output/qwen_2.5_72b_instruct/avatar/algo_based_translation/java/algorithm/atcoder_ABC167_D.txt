Function signatures and parameter/return types:
- `doIt()`: void
- `main(String[] args)`: void

Variable declarations and data types:
- `sc`: Scanner
- `MOD`: int, constant value 1000000007
- `MAX`: int, constant value Integer.MAX_VALUE
- `LMAX`: long, constant value Long.MAX_VALUE
- `len`: int, initialized to 1,000,001
- `N`: int
- `K`: long
- `A[]`: int array
- `used`: Set<Integer>
- `idx[]`: int array
- `pos[]`: int array
- `next`: int, initialized to 0
- `cur`: int, initialized to 0
- `a`: long
- `b`: long
- `ans`: int

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Initialize `sc` as a new Scanner object for System.in.
2. Read `N` as an integer from `sc`.
3. Read `K` as a long from `sc`.
4. Initialize `A[]` as an int array of size `N`.
5. For `i` from 0 to `N-1`, read an integer from `sc`, subtract 1, and store it in `A[i]`.
6. Initialize `used` as a new HashSet of Integer.
7. Initialize `idx[]` as an int array of size `N`.
8. Initialize `pos[]` as an int array of size `N`.
9. Set `next` to 0.
10. Set `cur` to 0.
11. While `used` does not contain `next`:
    1. Add `next` to `used`.
    2. Set `idx[next]` to `cur`.
    3. Set `pos[cur]` to `next`.
    4. Set `next` to `A[next]`.
    5. Increment `cur` by 1.
12. Set `a` to `cur - idx[next]` as a long.
13. Set `b` to `idx[next]` as a long.
14. Set `ans` to `(10000 * a + K - b) % a + b` as an int.
15. If `b` is greater than `K`, set `ans` to `K` as an int.
16. Print `pos[ans] + 1` to System.out.

Control structures:
- For loop: Iterates from 0 to `N-1`.
- While loop: Continues as long as `used` does not contain `next`.
- If conditional: Checks if `b` is greater than `K`.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Reads `N` and `K` from standard input.
- Reads `N` integers from standard input, processes them, and stores them in `A[]`.
- Uses a HashSet to track visited indices and two arrays to map indices and positions.
- Computes the final answer based on cycle detection and modular arithmetic.
- Outputs the result to standard output.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `java.util.*` for Scanner, HashSet.
