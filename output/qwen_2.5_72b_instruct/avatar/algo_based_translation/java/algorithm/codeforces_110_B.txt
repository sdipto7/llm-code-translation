Function Signature:
- main(String[] args) : void

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- n : int
- i : int
- j : int
- p : int
- c : char[]

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize n, i, j, and p with values 0, 0, 0, and 97 (ASCII for 'a') respectively.
2. Read an integer value from standard input and assign it to n.
3. Declare a character array c of size n.
4. For i from 0 to 3 (inclusive):
   - For j from i to n-1 with a step of 4:
     - Assign the ASCII character value of p to c[j].
     - Increment p by 1.
5. For i from 0 to n-1 (inclusive):
   - Print the character c[i] to standard output without a newline.

Input/Output Operations:
- Read an integer from standard input.
- Print characters to standard output.

Required Libraries:
- java.util.* (for Scanner class)
