Function: main()
Parameters: None
Return Type: None

Variable Declarations:
x: Integer
y: Integer
z: Integer
k: Integer
a: List of Integers
b: List of Integers
c: List of Integers
ab: List of Integers
abc: List of Integers
i: Integer
j: Integer

Logic Flow:
- Read a line of input and split it into four integers: x, y, z, k
- Read the next line of input, split it into integers, and store them in list a
- Read the next line of input, split it into integers, and store them in list b
- Read the next line of input, split it into integers, and store them in list c
- Initialize an empty list ab
- For each integer i from 0 to x-1:
    - For each integer j from 0 to y-1:
        - Append the sum of a[i] and b[j] to list ab
- Sort list ab in descending order
- Initialize an empty list abc
- For each integer i from 0 to min(k, x*y)-1:
    - For each integer j from 0 to z-1:
        - Append the sum of ab[i] and c[j] to list abc
- Sort list abc in descending order
- For each integer i from 0 to k-1:
    - Print the i-th element of abc
