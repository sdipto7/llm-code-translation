Function signature: `main()`
Variable declarations and data types:
- `n: int`
- `l: List[int]`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read integer input and assign to `n`.
2. Read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and assign the resulting list to `l`.
3. Sort the list `l` in ascending order.
4. For each element `i` in the sorted list `l`:
   - If `i + 1` is in `l` and `i + 2` is in `l`:
     - Print 'YES'.
     - Break out of the loop.
5. If the loop completes without finding such an `i`:
   - Print 'NO'.

Control structures:
- For loop iterating over each element `i` in `l`.
- If statement with condition `i + 1 in l and i + 2 in l`.
- Else block associated with the for loop.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Two lines from standard input. First line is an integer `n`. Second line is a space-separated string of integers.
- Output: Single line to standard output, either 'YES' or 'NO'.
- Data processing: Convert input strings to integers, sort the list, and check consecutive elements for the specified condition.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules are required. Only built-in functions and types are used.
