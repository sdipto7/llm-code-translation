- Function Signature: main() -> None
- Variable Declarations: age (int), a (int), b (int)
- Logic Flow:
  1. Read age from input and convert to integer
  2. If age equals 1:
     1. Print 'Hello World'
  3. Else:
     1. Read two integers from input and convert to integers
     2. Assign first integer to a
     3. Assign second integer to b
     4. Calculate sum of a and b
     5. Print the sum
- Control Structures:
  - If condition: age == 1
- Input/Output Operations:
  - Read age from input
  - Print 'Hello World' if age is 1
  - Read two integers from input if age is not 1
  - Print sum of two integers if age is not 1
- Required Libraries/Modules/Dependencies: None
