Function signature: `main()`
Parameter and return types: None

Variable declarations and data types:
- `n`: integer
- `a`: list of integers
- `b`: list of integers initialized with zeros
- `res`: integer initialized to 0

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read integer `n` from input
2. Read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and store in list `a`
3. Initialize list `b` with `n` zeros
4. For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
   - Set `b[a[i] - 1]` to `i`
5. Initialize `res` to 0
6. For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`:
   - Add the absolute difference between `b[i]` and `b[i-1]` to `res`
7. Print `res`

Control structures:
- For loop iterating over range `n` for initializing `b`
- For loop iterating over range from 1 to `n` for calculating `res`

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read `n` and then read `n` integers for list `a`
- Output: Print the final value of `res` which represents the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in transformed list `b`

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules required
