Function signature: `main()`
Variable declarations:
- `N` as integer
- `i` as integer, initialized to 1
- `ans` as integer, initialized to 0

Logic flow:
1. Read an integer input and assign it to `N`
2. Initialize `i` to 1
3. Initialize `ans` to 0
4. While `10 ** i` is less than or equal to `N`:
   a. Increment `ans` by `(10 ** i) - (10 ** (i - 1))`
   b. Increment `i` by 2
5. Increment `ans` by the maximum of 0 and `N - 10 ** (i - 1) + 1`
6. Print the value of `ans`

Input/output operations:
- Read an integer from standard input
- Print an integer to standard output

No additional libraries, modules, or dependencies required.
