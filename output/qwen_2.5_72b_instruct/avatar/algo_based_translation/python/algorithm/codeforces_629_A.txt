Function signature: `main() -> None`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `n: int`
- `cake: List[str]`
- `happiness: int`
- `chocCount: int`
- `nfat: int`
- `posCount: int`
- `line: str`
- `i: int`
- `j: int`

Logic flow and control structures:
1. Read integer `n` from input.
2. Initialize `cake` as an empty list.
3. Initialize `happiness` to 0.
4. Initialize `chocCount` to 0.
5. Initialize `nfat` to 1.
6. For `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
   - Read string `line` from input.
   - Append `line` to `cake`.
   - For each character `j` in `line`:
     - If `j` equals 'C':
       - Increment `chocCount` by 1.
   - If `chocCount` is greater than 1:
     - For `i` from `chocCount` down to `chocCount - 2` (inclusive):
       - Multiply `nfat` by `i`.
     - Add `nfat / 2` to `happiness`.
   - Reset `nfat` to 1.
   - Reset `chocCount` to 0.
7. Initialize `posCount` to 0.
8. For `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
   - For `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If character at position `j` in `cake[i]` equals 'C':
       - Increment `chocCount` by 1.
   - If `chocCount` is greater than 1:
     - For `i` from `chocCount` down to `chocCount - 2` (inclusive):
       - Multiply `nfat` by `i`.
     - Add `nfat / 2` to `happiness`.
   - Reset `nfat` to 1.
   - Reset `chocCount` to 0.
9. Print `happiness` as an integer.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads integer `n`, followed by `n` lines of strings.
- Output: Prints the integer value of `happiness`.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules are required.
