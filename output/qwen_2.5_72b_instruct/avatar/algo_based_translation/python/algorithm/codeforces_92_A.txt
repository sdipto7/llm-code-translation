Function signature: `calculate_remaining(int n, int m) -> int`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `n`: int
- `m`: int
- `i`: int

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Read two integers from input, assign to `n` and `m`
2. Initialize `i` to 1
3. While `m` is greater than or equal to `i`:
   a. Subtract `i` from `m`
   b. Update `i` to `(i % n) + 1`
4. Print `m`

Control structures:
- While loop with condition `m >= i`

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Two integers separated by space, assigned to `n` and `m`
- Output: The value of `m` after the loop ends

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required
