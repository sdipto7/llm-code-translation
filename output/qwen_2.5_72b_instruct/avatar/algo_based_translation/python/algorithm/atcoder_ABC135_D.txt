Algorithm:

- Import sys, math, and defaultdict from collections
- Set recursion limit to 10^7
- Define input function to read a line from stdin and strip newline character
- Define mod as 10^9 + 7
- Define function I to return an integer from input
- Define function II to return a map of integers from input split by spaces
- Define function III to return a list of integers from input split by spaces
- Define function Line to read N lines of input, split by spaces, convert to integers, and return transposed tuples as lists
- Read input string S
- Calculate length n of S
- If n equals 1:
    - If S equals '5' or '?':
        - Print 1
        - Exit program
    - Else:
        - Print 0
        - Exit program
- Initialize dp as a 2D list of size n x 13 with all elements set to 0
- For i from 0 to n-1:
    - If i equals 0:
        - If S[i] is not '?':
            - Increment dp[i][int(S[i])] by 1
        - Else:
            - For j from 0 to 9:
                - Increment dp[i][j] by 1
    - Else:
        - If S[i] is not '?':
            - For k from 0 to 12:
                - Increment dp[i][(k * 10 + int(S[i])) % 13] by dp[i-1][k]
        - Else:
            - For j from 0 to 9:
                - For k from 0 to 12:
                    - Increment dp[i][(k * 10 + j) % 13] by dp[i-1][k]
        - For k from 0 to 12:
            - Update dp[i][k] to dp[i][k] % mod
- Print dp[n-1][5]
