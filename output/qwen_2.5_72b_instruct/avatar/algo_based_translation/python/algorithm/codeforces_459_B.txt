Function signature:
- main() -> None

Variable declarations and data types:
- n: int
- l1: List[int]
- a: int
- b: int
- ac: int
- bc: int

Execution flow and logic:
- Input an integer n from the user
- Input a list of integers l1 from the user, split by spaces
- Sort the list l1 in ascending order
- Assign the last element of l1 to a
- Assign the first element of l1 to b
- If a is equal to b:
  - Print the result of a - b
  - Print the result of (n * (n - 1)) // 2
- Else:
  - Count occurrences of a in l1 and assign to ac
  - Count occurrences of b in l1 and assign to bc
  - Print the result of a - b
  - Print the result of ac * bc

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Read an integer n from standard input
- Read a space-separated string, split it, convert each element to an integer, and store in list l1
- Sort the list l1
- Compare the maximum and minimum values in l1 (stored in a and b)
- If all elements are the same, calculate the number of possible pairs in the list using the formula for combinations of n elements taken 2 at a time
- If there are different elements, calculate the number of pairs consisting of the maximum and minimum values
- Output the difference between the maximum and minimum values
- Output the number of valid pairs

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules are required
