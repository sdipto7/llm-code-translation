Function signatures with parameter and return types:
- combi(N: int, K: int) -> float

Variable declarations and data types:
- N: int
- P: int
- ans: int
- lis: List[int]
- ls: List[int]
- one: int
- zero: int
- pattern_a: int
- pattern_b: int
- j: int
- a: float
- i: int
- time: int

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Read two space-separated integers from input and assign to N, P.
2. Define function combi(N, K):
   a. Initialize a to 1.
   b. For i from 0 to K-1, multiply a by (N - i).
   c. For j from 0 to K-1, divide a by (j + 1).
   d. Return a.
3. Initialize ans to 0.
4. Read a list of integers from input and assign to lis.
5. Initialize ls as an empty list.
6. For each element a in lis, append a % 2 to ls.
7. Count the number of 1s in ls and assign to one.
8. Count the number of 0s in ls and assign to zero.
9. Initialize pattern_a to 0.
10. Initialize pattern_b to 0.
11. For j from 0 to zero:
    a. Add combi(zero, j) to pattern_b.
12. Initialize time to 0.
13. While time is less than or equal to one:
    a. If time % 2 equals P, add combi(one, time) to pattern_a.
    b. Increment time by 1.
14. Print the integer value of pattern_a * pattern_b.

Control structures:
- Loops:
  a. For i from 0 to K-1 in combi function.
  b. For j from 0 to K-1 in combi function.
  c. For a in lis.
  d. For j from 0 to zero.
  e. While time <= one.
- Conditionals:
  a. If time % 2 == P inside the while loop.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Read two integers from input.
- Read a list of integers from input.
- Process the list to count 1s and 0s.
- Calculate combinations using the combi function.
- Calculate pattern_a and pattern_b based on the counts and P.
- Print the final result as an integer.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules are required.
