Algorithm:
- Import sys module
- Define input function as sys.stdin.readline
- Declare n as integer, read from input
- Declare w as list of integers, read from input, split by spaces
- Declare x as the sum of all elements in w
- Declare d as an empty list
- For each index i from 0 to n-1:
    - If (x - w[i]) / (n - 1) equals w[i]:
        - Append i + 1 to d
- Print length of d
- Print elements of d as space-separated string
