Function Signature: `calculate_and_print_sequence(r: int, D: int, x: int) -> None`

Variable Declarations:
- `r`: int
- `D`: int
- `x`: int
- `i`: int

Logic Flow:
1. Read input values for `r`, `D`, and `x` as integers.
2. For each integer `i` from 2 to 11 (inclusive):
   - Calculate the value of the expression `(r ** (i - 1)) * (x + D / (1 - r)) - D / (1 - r)`.
   - Convert the result to an integer.
   - Print the resulting integer value.

Control Structures:
- Loop: For loop with `i` ranging from 2 to 11 (inclusive).

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read a single line of input containing three space-separated integers `r`, `D`, and `x`.
- Output: Print an integer value for each iteration of the loop from 2 to 11.

Data Processing Logic:
- For each value of `i` in the specified range, compute the given formula and print the result.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules are required.
