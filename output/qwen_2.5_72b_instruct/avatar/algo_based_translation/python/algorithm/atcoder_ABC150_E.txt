Algorithm:
- Function Signature: `main() -> None`
- Variable Declarations:
  - `mod: int = 10 ** 9 + 7`
  - `n: int`
  - `c: List[int]`
  - `b: int`
  - `a: int`
  - `ans: int = 0`
  - `i: int` (loop variable)
- Execution Order:
  - Read integer `n` from input
  - Read list `c` of `n` integers from input, split by spaces
  - Sort list `c` in descending order
  - Calculate `b` as `2` raised to the power of `2 * n - 2`, modulo `mod`
  - Calculate `a` as `2 * b`, modulo `mod`
  - Initialize `ans` to `0`
  - For each index `i` from `0` to `n - 1`:
    - Update `ans` by adding `c[i] * (a + i * b)`
    - Update `ans` by taking modulo `mod` of `ans`
  - Print the final value of `ans`
- Input/Output Operations:
  - Read `n` as an integer from standard input
  - Read a line of space-separated integers and convert to a list `c`
  - Print the final result `ans` to standard output
- Data Processing Logic:
  - Sorting the list `c` in descending order
  - Computing powers and modular arithmetic to derive coefficients
  - Accumulating weighted sums based on the sorted list and computed coefficients
- Required Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
  - `List` from `typing` module (if type annotations are to be strictly followed, though not necessary for execution)
