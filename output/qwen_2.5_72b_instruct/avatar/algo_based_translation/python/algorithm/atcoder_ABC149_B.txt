Function Signature:
- Function Name: main
- Parameters: None
- Return Type: None

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- cookies: List of Integers
- leftOver: Integer
- takahashi: Integer

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. Read input as a single line of space-separated values.
2. Convert the input string into a list of integers, assigning it to cookies.
3. Calculate the difference between the first and third elements of cookies, assigning it to leftOver.
4. Assign the maximum of 0 and leftOver to takahashi.
5. Check if takahashi is greater than 0:
   a. If true, convert takahashi to a string and concatenate it with a space and the second element of cookies converted to a string.
   b. If false, calculate the difference between the second element of cookies and the absolute value of leftOver, take the maximum of 0 and this value, convert it to a string, and concatenate it with a space and takahashi converted to a string.
6. Print the resulting concatenated string.

Control Structures:
- Conditional (if-else) with condition: takahashi > 0

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input: A single line of space-separated integers.
- Output: A single line of space-separated integers.
- Data Processing: Arithmetic operations (subtraction, absolute value), comparison operations, and conversion between string and integer types.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- None
