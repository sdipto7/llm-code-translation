Function signature:
- main() -> None

Variable declarations and data types:
- n: int
- x: int

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read an integer value from standard input and store it in n.
2. Initialize x to 1.
3. While the logarithm base 2 of n is not an integer:
   a. Increment x by 1.
   b. Subtract 2 raised to the power of the integer part of the logarithm base 2 of n from n.
4. Print the value of x.

Control structures:
- While loop: Condition is math.log2(n) % 1, which checks if the logarithm base 2 of n is not an integer.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: An integer n is read from standard input.
- Output: The final value of x is printed to standard output.
- Data processing: The algorithm calculates how many times it needs to subtract the largest possible power of 2 from n until n becomes a power of 2, incrementing x each time.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- math module for the log2 function
