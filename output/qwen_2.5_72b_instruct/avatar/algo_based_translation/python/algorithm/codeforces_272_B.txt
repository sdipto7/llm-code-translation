- Function Signature: `main() -> int`
  - No parameters
  - Returns an integer
- Function Signature: `nPairsWithCommonFX(sequence: List[int]) -> int`
  - Takes a list of integers as input
  - Returns an integer
- Function Signature: `f(n: int) -> int`
  - Takes an integer as input
  - Returns an integer
- Variable Declarations:
  - `storage: Dict[int, List[int]]` (in `nPairsWithCommonFX`)
  - `FXs: List[int]` (in `nPairsWithCommonFX`)
  - `y: int` (in `f`)
- Execution Flow:
  - `main` calls `input()` to read a line (not used)
  - `main` reads another line, splits it into integers, and calls `nPairsWithCommonFX` with the list of integers
  - `nPairsWithCommonFX` initializes `storage` as an empty dictionary and `FXs` as an empty list
  - For each `value` in `sequence`:
    - Calls `f(value)` and stores result in `y`
    - If `y` is not in `storage`:
      - Adds `y` to `storage` with `value` in a new list
      - Appends `y` to `FXs`
    - Otherwise:
      - Appends `value` to the existing list in `storage` under key `y`
  - Calculates the sum of the square of lengths of lists in `storage` for each key in `FXs`
  - Subtracts the sum of lengths of lists in `storage` for each key in `FXs`
  - Divides the result by 2 and returns it
- Control Structures:
  - For loop in `nPairsWithCommonFX` iterates over each `value` in `sequence`
  - If-else statement in `nPairsWithCommonFX` checks if `y` is in `storage`
  - While loop in `f` continues until `n` is 1
  - If-else statement in `f` checks if `n` is odd
- Input/Output:
  - `main` reads two lines of input from the user
  - `main` prints the result returned by `nPairsWithCommonFX`
- No external libraries, modules, or dependencies required
