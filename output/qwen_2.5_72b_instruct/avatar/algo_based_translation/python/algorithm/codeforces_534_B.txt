Algorithm:
Function: main()
Parameters: None
Return Type: None

Variable Declarations:
v1: Integer
v2: Integer
t: Integer
d: Integer
a: Integer
v: Integer
distance: Integer
i: Integer

Execution Flow:
1. Input two space-separated values as strings, split them, and assign the first to v1 and the second to v2.
2. Input two space-separated values as strings, split them, and assign the first to t and the second to d.
3. Convert v1, v2, t, and d from strings to integers.
4. Initialize a to 1.
5. Initialize v to v1.
6. Initialize distance to 0.
7. For i from 0 to t-1:
    a. If v - v2 is greater than (t - i - 1) * d:
        i. Multiply a by -1.
        ii. Assign (t - i - 1) * d + v2 to v.
    b. Add v to distance.
    c. Add a * d to v.
8. Print distance.

Input/Output Operations:
- Read two lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers.
- Print a single integer representing the distance.

Data Processing Logic:
- The algorithm simulates a process where a value v changes over time t, adjusting based on a decrement d and a threshold v2.
- The direction of change (increment or decrement) is controlled by the variable a, which flips when v exceeds a certain threshold relative to the remaining time and decrement.

Required Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- None
