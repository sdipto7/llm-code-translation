Function Signature:
- `main()` -> None

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `a` : string
- `b` : string
- `x` : integer
- `s` : string
- `c` : integer
- `d` : integer
- `i` : integer

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. Import `sys` module
2. Read input from standard input, strip newline, split into two strings `a` and `b`
3. Calculate `x` as the maximum length between `a` and `b`
4. Right justify `a` to length `x` with '0's padding
5. Left justify `b` to length `x` with '0's padding
6. Initialize `s` as an empty string
7. Initialize `c` as 0 (carry)
8. For each index `i` from 0 to `x-1`:
   - Calculate `d` as the sum of the integer at position `i` in `b`, the integer at position `x-i-1` in `a`, and `c`
   - If `d` is greater than 9:
     - Append the second digit of `d` to `s`
     - Set `c` to 1
   - Else:
     - Append `d` as a string to `s`
     - Set `c` to 0
9. If `c` is 1 after the loop:
   - Append '1' to `s`
10. Print the integer value of `s` reversed

Control Structures:
- Loop: For loop from 0 to `x-1`
- Conditional: If `d > 9`

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input: Reads two space-separated strings from standard input
- Output: Prints the result of the arithmetic operation as an integer
- Data Processing: Adds corresponding digits of the two numbers including carry, constructs the result string, handles carry at the end

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- `sys` module
