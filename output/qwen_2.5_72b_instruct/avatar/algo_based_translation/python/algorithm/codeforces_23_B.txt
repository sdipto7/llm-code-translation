Function Signature: `main()`

Variable Declarations:
- `n` as Integer
- `i` as Integer
- `a` as Integer

Logic Flow:
1. Read an integer input and assign it to `n`.
2. For each integer `i` from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive):
   1. Read an integer input and assign it to `a`.
   2. If `a` is less than 2:
      1. Print 0.
   3. If `a` is greater than or equal to 2:
      1. Print `a - 2`.

Control Structures:
- For loop: Iterates `n` times with index `i`.
- If statement: Checks if `a` is less than 2.
- If statement: Checks if `a` is greater than or equal to 2.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Reads an integer for `n`.
- Input: Reads an integer for `a` in each iteration of the loop.
- Output: Prints 0 if `a` is less than 2.
- Output: Prints `a - 2` if `a` is greater than or equal to 2.

Data Processing Logic:
- Compares the value of `a` to determine the output based on the conditions provided.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No specific libraries or modules required. Uses basic Python functionality.
