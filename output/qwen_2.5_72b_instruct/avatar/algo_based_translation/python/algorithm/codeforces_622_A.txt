Function Signature:
- main() -> None

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- n: int
- l: int
- r: int
- mid: int
- idxcnt: float

Logic Flow:
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to n
2. Initialize l to 1
3. Initialize r to n
4. While l is less than r:
   a. Calculate mid as l + (r - l) // 2
   b. Calculate idxcnt as mid * (mid + 1) / 2
   c. If idxcnt is less than n:
      i. Increment l by 1
   d. Else:
      i. Assign mid to r
5. Decrement l by 1
6. Recalculate idxcnt as l * (l + 1) / 2
7. Print the integer value of n - idxcnt

Input/Output Operations:
- Read an integer from standard input
- Print an integer to standard output

Data Processing Logic:
- The algorithm uses binary search to find the largest integer l such that the sum of the first l natural numbers is less than or equal to n.
- After finding l, it calculates the sum of the first l natural numbers and subtracts it from n to find the result.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- cmd module (IDENTCHARS is imported but not used in the provided code)
