Function: calculate_sho(h: int, a: int) -> int

Variable Declarations:
- h: int
- a: int
- sho: int
- am: int

Logic Flow:
1. Read input as a single line string
2. Split the string by space to get two parts
3. Convert the two parts to integers and assign them to h and a respectively
4. Calculate the integer division of h by a and assign the result to sho
5. Calculate the remainder of h divided by a and assign the result to am
6. If am is not equal to 0:
   - Increment sho by 1
7. Print the value of sho

Input/Output Operations:
- Read input from standard input
- Print output to standard output

Data Processing Logic:
- Perform integer division and modulus operations on input values
- Conditionally adjust the result based on the remainder

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules are required
