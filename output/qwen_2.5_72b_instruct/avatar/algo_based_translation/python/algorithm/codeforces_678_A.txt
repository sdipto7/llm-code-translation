Function signature: `main() -> None`
Variable declarations and data types: `vamshi: int`, `z: int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read a line of input from the standard input.
2. Split the input line into two parts.
3. Convert the first part to an integer and assign it to `vamshi`.
4. Convert the second part to an integer and assign it to `z`.
5. Perform integer division of `vamshi` by `z` and add 1 to the result.
6. Multiply the result from step 5 by `z`.
7. Print the result from step 6.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads a single line containing two space-separated integers.
- Output: Prints a single integer which is the result of `(vamshi // z + 1) * z`.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No external libraries, modules, or dependencies required.
