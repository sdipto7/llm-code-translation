Function Signature: `calculate_result(s: str) -> int`

Variable Declarations:
- `s: str` (input string)
- `l: int` (constant value set to 2019)
- `m: List[int]` (list initialized with 1 at index 0 and 0s up to index 2018)
- `a: int` (accumulator for the reversed string digits multiplied by powers of 10)
- `r: int` (result accumulator)

Logic Flow:
1. Read input string `s`
2. Initialize `l` to 2019
3. Initialize `m` as a list with 2019 elements, setting the first element to 1 and the rest to 0
4. Initialize `a` to 0
5. Initialize `r` to 0
6. Loop through each character `e` in the reversed string `s` with index `i`:
   - Convert `e` to an integer and multiply by 10 raised to the power of `i` modulo `l`, add the result to `a`
   - Add the value at index `a % l` in `m` to `r`
   - Increment the value at index `a % l` in `m` by 1
7. Print `r`

Control Structures:
- For loop iterating over the reversed string `s` with `enumerate`

Input/Output Operations:
- Read input string `s` from standard input
- Print the final result `r` to standard output

Data Processing Logic:
- Process each digit of the input string in reverse order
- Calculate a running total `a` of the digits weighted by decreasing powers of 10 modulo 2019
- Use `a % l` to index into `m`, accumulating `r` based on previous occurrences of the same index
- Update `m` to reflect the new occurrence of the index

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- None (uses built-in functions and data types)
