Function: main()
Parameters: None
Return Type: None

Variable Declarations:
N: int
M: int
A: numpy.ndarray[int64]
cum_remainders: numpy.ndarray[int64]
remainder_counts: Counter[int]
combinations: int

Logic Flow:
1. Import sys, collections.Counter, numpy
2. Read a line from standard input, split it into two integers, and assign them to N and M
3. Read another line from standard input, split it into integers, convert them to int64 numpy array, and assign to A
4. Create a new numpy array cum_remainders by first horizontally stacking 0 and A, then taking modulo M of each element, and finally taking the cumulative sum modulo M
5. Count the occurrences of each element in cum_remainders and store in remainder_counts
6. Initialize combinations to 0
7. For each count in remainder_counts values:
   - Add count * (count - 1) // 2 to combinations
8. Print the value of combinations
