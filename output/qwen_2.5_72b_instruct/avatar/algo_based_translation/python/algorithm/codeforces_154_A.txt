Function Signature: `main() -> None`

Variable Declarations:
- `s: str`
- `n: int`
- `ans: int`
- `i: int` (loop variable)
- `x: str`
- `a: int`
- `b: int`
- `j: str` (loop variable)

Execution Order and Logic Flow:

1. Read a string `s` from input.
2. Read an integer `n` from input.
3. Initialize `ans` to 0.
4. For each integer `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
   1. Read a string `x` from input.
   2. Initialize `a` to 0.
   3. Initialize `b` to 0.
   4. For each character `j` in `s`:
      1. If `j` is equal to the first character of `x`:
         1. Increment `a` by 1.
      2. Else if `j` is equal to the second character of `x`:
         1. Increment `b` by 1.
      3. Else:
         1. Add the minimum of `a` and `b` to `ans`.
         2. Set `a` to 0.
         3. Set `b` to 0.
   5. Add the minimum of `a` and `b` to `ans`.
5. Print the value of `ans`.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Reads a string, an integer, and `n` strings.
- Output: Prints an integer.

Data Processing Logic:
- Counts occurrences of two specified characters in a string.
- Calculates the sum of the minimum counts of these characters between interruptions by other characters.

No external libraries, modules, or dependencies are required.
