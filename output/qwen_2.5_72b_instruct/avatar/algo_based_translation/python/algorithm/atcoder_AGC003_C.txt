Function signature: main() -> None

Variable declarations:
- N: int
- A: list of int
- cnt: int
- i: int
- d: int

Logic flow:
1. Read an integer input and assign it to N.
2. Create a list A of N integers where each element is calculated as (input integer * N) + i for i ranging from 0 to N-1.
3. Sort the list A.
4. Initialize cnt to 0.
5. Loop over each index i from 0 to N-1:
   - Calculate d as (A[i] % N) % 2.
   - If d % 2 is not equal to i % 2, increment cnt by 1.
6. Print the integer division of cnt by 2.

Input/output operations:
- Read a single integer from standard input to initialize N.
- Read N integers from standard input to calculate the elements of A.
- Print a single integer to standard output which is the result of cnt // 2.

Data processing logic:
- The list A is generated based on the formula provided.
- The list A is sorted to ensure the elements are in ascending order.
- The loop checks the parity of the remainder of each element in A divided by N and compares it with the parity of its index.
- The counter cnt is incremented whenever the parities do not match.
- The final result is half of the count of mismatched parities, indicating the number of swaps needed to make the parities match.

Libraries/modules/dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules are required.
