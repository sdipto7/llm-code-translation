Function Signature: `calculate_result(A: int, B: int) -> int`

Variable Declarations:
- `A: int`
- `B: int`
- `ans: int`

Execution Order:
1. Read input as a single line of space-separated integers.
2. Split the input string into two parts and convert each part to an integer, assigning the first integer to `A` and the second to `B`.
3. Compute `ans` as `A - 2 * B`.
4. If `ans` is less than 0, set `ans` to 0.
5. Print the value of `ans`.

Control Structures:
- If condition: `if ans < 0:`

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read a single line from standard input and split it into two integers.
- Output: Print the integer value of `ans`.

Data Processing Logic:
- Subtract twice the value of `B` from `A`.
- Ensure the result is not negative by setting it to 0 if it is.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No specific libraries or modules are required. The code uses built-in Python functions.
