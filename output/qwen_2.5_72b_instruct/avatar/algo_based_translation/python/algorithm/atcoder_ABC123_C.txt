Algorithm:
- Function Signature: main() -> None
- Variable Declarations:
  - N: int
  - A: list of int (length 5)
- Logic Flow:
  1. Read integer input from the user and assign it to N
  2. Initialize an empty list A
  3. For i from 0 to 4 (inclusive):
     a. Read integer input from the user
     b. Append the integer to A
  4. Find the minimum value in list A
  5. Divide N by the minimum value found in step 4
  6. Apply ceiling function to the result of step 5
  7. Add 4 to the result of step 6
  8. Print the result of step 7
- Control Structures:
  - For loop: Iterates from 0 to 4 inclusive
- Input/Output Operations:
  - Read integer input from the user twice: once for N and five times for elements of A
  - Print a single integer which is the final result
- Data Processing Logic:
  - Calculate the minimum value in the list A
  - Perform division and ceiling operation on the input N using the minimum value
  - Perform addition of 4 to the result of the ceiling operation
- Required Libraries:
  - math (for math.ceil)
  - implicit usage of built-in functions:
    - int() for type conversion
    - input() for reading input from user
    - min() for finding the minimum value in a list
