Function Signature: main() -> None

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
a: List[int]
e: int
i: int

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. Read a line of input from the standard input.
2. Split the input string by spaces.
3. Convert each split string element to an integer and store them in the list `a`.
4. Iterate over the list `a` with `enumerate`, assigning the index to `e` and the value to `i`.
5. Check if `i` is equal to 0.
6. If `i` is equal to 0:
   a. Print the value of `e + 1`.
   b. Break out of the loop.

Control Structures:
- For Loop: Iterates over the list `a` with `enumerate`.
- Conditional: Checks if `i` is equal to 0.

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input: Reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input.
- Output: Prints the 1-based index of the first occurrence of 0 in the list `a`.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
None
