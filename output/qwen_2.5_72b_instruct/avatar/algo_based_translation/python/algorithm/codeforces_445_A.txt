Function signature: main() -> None

Variable declarations and data types:
n: int
m: int
l: List[List[str]]
s: List[str]
i: int
j: int
c: List[str]

Logic flow in execution order:

1. Read two integers n and m from standard input, separated by whitespace.
2. Initialize an empty list l to store rows of characters.
3. Loop i from 0 to n-1:
   1. Read a string s from standard input.
   2. Convert string s to a list of characters.
   3. Loop j from 0 to m-1:
      1. If character at index j in list s is '.':
         1. If (i + j) is odd:
            1. Set character at index j in list s to 'W'.
         2. Else:
            1. Set character at index j in list s to 'B'.
   4. Append list s to list l.
4. Loop c over each element in list l:
   1. Join list c into a string.
   2. Print the resulting string to standard output.

Control structures:
- For loop iterating over range(n) with loop variable i.
- For loop iterating over range(m) with loop variable j.
- If-else conditional checking if character at index j in list s is '.', and if (i + j) is odd.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Two integers n and m, followed by n lines of strings, each of length m.
- Output: n lines of strings, each of length m, where '.' characters are replaced by 'W' or 'B' based on the sum of their row and column indices.
- Data processing involves reading input, modifying the grid based on specified rules, and then outputting the modified grid.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules are required. The code uses built-in Python functions and data structures.
