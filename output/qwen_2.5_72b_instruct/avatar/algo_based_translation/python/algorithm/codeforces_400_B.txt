Function Signature: `main() -> None`

Variable Declarations:
- `n: int`
- `m: int`
- `c: set[int]`
- `s: str`
- `a: int`

Logic Flow:
1. Read a line of input, split it into two integers, assign the first to `n` and the second to `m`.
2. Initialize an empty set `c`.
3. For each integer `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`:
   1. Read a line of input and assign it to `s`.
   2. Calculate the difference between the index of the first occurrence of "S" in `s` and the index of the first occurrence of "G" in `s`.
   3. Add the calculated difference to the set `c`.
4. If any element `a` in the set `c` is less than `0`:
   1. Print `-1`.
5. Otherwise:
   1. Print the length of the set `c`.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Two integers `n` and `m` on the first line, followed by `n` lines of strings.
- Output: A single integer `-1` if any difference is negative, otherwise the size of the set `c`.

Data Processing Logic:
- For each string, find the positions of "S" and "G", compute their difference, and store unique differences in a set.
- Check if any difference is negative to determine the output.

Required Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules are required.
