Function signature: `main()`

Variable declarations:
- `s` (list of characters)
- `x` (boolean)
- `dt` (dictionary with character keys and integer values)
- `i` (character)
- `key` (character)
- `value` (integer)
- `cnt` (integer)

Logic flow:
1. Read a string input from the user and convert it to a list of characters `s`.
2. Initialize `x` to `True`.
3. Initialize an empty dictionary `dt`.
4. Iterate over each character `i` in the list `s`:
   - If `i` is a key in `dt`, increment the value associated with `i` by 1.
   - Otherwise, add `i` as a key in `dt` with a value of 1.
5. Initialize `cnt` to 0.
6. Set `x` to `True`.
7. Iterate over each key-value pair `(key, value)` in `dt`:
   - If `value` is odd and `cnt` is less than 1, increment `cnt` by 1.
   - Else if `value` is odd and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 1, set `x` to `False` and break the loop.
8. If `x` is `True`, print "First".
9. Else if `x` is `False` and the length of `s` is even, print "Second".
10. Else if `x` is `False` and the length of `s` is odd, print "First".
