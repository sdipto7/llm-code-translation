Function Signature: `main() -> None`

Variable Declarations:
- `l: int`
- `r: int`
- `curr: int`
- `s: int`
- `first: int`
- `second: int`
- `ans: int`
- `i: int`
- `rev: str`
- `k: str`

Complete Logic Flow:

1. Read input values for `l` and `r` as integers from standard input.
2. Set `curr` to `r`.
3. Initialize `s` to 0.
4. While `curr` is not zero:
   a. Increment `s` by 1.
   b. Divide `curr` by 10 using integer division.
5. Calculate `first` as 10 raised to the power of `s`.
6. Calculate `second` as `first` divided by 2.
7. Initialize `ans` to -1.
8. For each value `i` in the list `[l, r, first, second]`:
   a. If `i` is between `l` and `r` inclusive:
      i. Set `curr` to `i`.
      ii. Initialize `rev` to an empty string.
      iii. For each character `k` in the string representation of `curr`:
           1. Append the string representation of `9 - int(k)` to `rev`.
      iv. Update `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and the product of the integer representation of `rev` and `curr`.
9. Print `ans`.
