Function signatures:
- `na() -> List[int]`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `na: Callable[[], List[int]]`
- `n: int`
- `x: int`
- `a: List[int]`
- `ans: int`
- `i: int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Define `na` as a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and returns the list of integers.
2. Assign the first element of the list returned by `na()` to `n` and the second element to `x`.
3. Assign the sorted list returned by `na()` to `a`.
4. Initialize `ans` to 0.
5. If the first element of `a` is greater than `x`, print 0 and terminate the program.
6. For each element `i` in `a`:
   - If `i` is greater than `x`, set `x` to 0 and break the loop.
   - Otherwise, subtract `i` from `x` and increment `ans` by 1.
7. If `x` is not equal to 0, decrement `ans` by 1.
8. Print `ans`.

Control structures:
- Conditional: `if a[0] > x`
- Loop: `for i in a`
- Conditional inside loop: `if i > x`

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads two lines of input. The first line contains two integers `n` and `x`. The second line contains `n` integers.
- Output: Prints an integer representing the answer.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `List` and `Callable` from `typing` module (though not explicitly imported, implied by type hints)
