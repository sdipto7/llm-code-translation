Function Signature:
- `main() -> None`

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `n: int`
- `number: List[int]`
- `h1: int`
- `h2: int`
- `x: int`
- `i: int`

Logic Flow in Execution Order:

1. Read integer input and assign to `n`
2. Read string input, convert each character to integer, and store in list `number`
3. Initialize `h1` to 0
4. Initialize `h2` to 0
5. Initialize `x` to 0
6. For loop with index `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1` inclusive:
   - If `number[i]` is not equal to 4 and `number[i]` is not equal to 7:
     - Print "NO"
     - Increment `x` by 1
     - Break out of the loop
   - If `i` is less than `n // 2`:
     - Add `number[i]` to `h1`
   - Otherwise:
     - Add `number[i]` to `h2`
7. If `x` is equal to 0:
   - If `h1` is equal to `h2`:
     - Print "YES"
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO"

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input operations:
  - Read integer input for `n`
  - Read string input, split into characters, convert each to integer, and store in `number`
- Output operations:
  - Print "NO" if any element in `number` is neither 4 nor 7
  - Print "YES" if sum of first half of `number` equals sum of second half of `number`, otherwise print "NO"

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- `List` from `typing` module (implied by `List[int]` type hint)
