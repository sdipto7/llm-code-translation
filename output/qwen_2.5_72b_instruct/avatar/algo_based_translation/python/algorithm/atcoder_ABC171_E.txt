Function signature: main() -> None

Variable declarations and data types:
- N: int
- a: List[int]
- total: int

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read an integer N from standard input
2. Read a line from standard input, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and store the result in list a
3. Compute the cumulative XOR of all elements in list a starting with an initial value of 0; store the result in total
4. For each element ai in list a, compute the XOR of ai and total, convert the result to a string, and collect all these strings into a list
5. Join the list of strings into a single string with spaces between each element
6. Print the resulting string to standard output

Control structures:
- No explicit loops or conditionals are present in the provided code

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads two lines from standard input; the first line is a single integer N, and the second line contains N integers separated by spaces
- Output: Prints a single line containing N space-separated integers, where each integer is the result of XORing the corresponding integer from the input list with the cumulative XOR of all integers in the input list

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- functools.reduce
- operator.xor
