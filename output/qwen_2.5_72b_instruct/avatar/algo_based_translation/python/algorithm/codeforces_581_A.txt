Function signature: main() -> None

Variable declarations:
a: int
b: int

Logic flow:
1. Read a line of input from the standard input
2. Split the input line into two parts based on whitespace
3. Convert each part of the split input into an integer
4. Assign the first integer to variable a
5. Assign the second integer to variable b
6. Compute the minimum of a and b
7. Compute the maximum of a and b
8. Compute the absolute difference between a and b by subtracting the minimum from the maximum
9. Integer divide the absolute difference by 2
10. Print the minimum of a and b followed by the result of the integer division, separated by a space

Input/output operations:
- Read a single line of input containing two integers separated by whitespace
- Output two integers: the smaller of the two input integers followed by half the absolute difference between the two integers

Data processing logic:
- Determine the smaller of the two input integers
- Calculate the absolute difference between the two integers
- Find half of the absolute difference
- Output the results in the specified format

Libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No specific imports required, uses built-in functions and types
