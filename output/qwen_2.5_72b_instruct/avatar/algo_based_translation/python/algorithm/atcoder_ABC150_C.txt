- Function signatures with parameter and return types:
  - main(): None

- Variable declarations and data types:
  - n: int
  - orig: List[Tuple[int]]
  - p: Tuple[int]
  - q: Tuple[int]
  - pn: int
  - qn: int

- Complete logic flow in execution order:
  1. Read integer input from stdin and assign to n
  2. Import itertools module
  3. Generate all permutations of the list [1, 2, ..., n] using itertools.permutations and convert to list of tuples, assign to orig
  4. Read a line of input from stdin, split by spaces, convert each element to int, and assign to p as a tuple
  5. Read a line of input from stdin, split by spaces, convert each element to int, and assign to q as a tuple
  6. Find the index of permutation p in orig and assign to pn
  7. Find the index of permutation q in orig and assign to qn
  8. Calculate the absolute difference between pn and qn, print the result

- Control structures (loops, conditionals) with exact conditions:
  - No explicit loops or conditionals

- Input/output operations and data processing logic:
  - Input operations: Two lines of space-separated integers read from stdin
  - Data processing logic: Generate permutations, find indices of specific permutations, calculate absolute difference
  - Output operations: Print the absolute difference between the indices of permutations p and q

- Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
  - itertools
