Function Signatures:
- `bfs(v: int, N: int, G: List[Deque[int]], E: Dict[Tuple[int, int], int]) -> int`
- `main() -> None`

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `visited: List[int]` initialized as `[0] * N`
- `queue: Deque[int]` initialized as `deque()`
- `K: int` initialized as `-1`
- `node2color: List[int]` initialized as `[-1 for _ in range(N)]`
- `q: int` used in the while loop
- `color: int` used in the inner loop
- `nex: int` iterated over in the for loop
- `N: int` read from input
- `G: List[Deque[int]]` initialized as `[deque() for _ in range(N)]`
- `E: Dict[Tuple[int, int], int]` initialized as `dict()`
- `a: int` and `b: int` read from input in the for loop

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
- `main()` starts by reading `N` as an integer from input.
- Initializes `G` as a list of deques and `E` as a dictionary.
- Reads `N-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b`. Decrements `a` and `b` by 1 to convert to 0-based indexing. Adds edges between `a` and `b` in `G` and initializes the corresponding entry in `E` with `0`.
- Calls `bfs(0, N, G, E)` and stores the result in `K`.
- Prints `K`.
- Iterates over values in `E` and prints each value.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- `collections.deque`
- `sys.stdin.readline`

Control Structures:
- `while queue:` checks if the queue is not empty.
- `for nex in G[q]:` iterates over neighbors of `q`.
- `if visited[nex]:` skips the iteration if `nex` has already been visited.
- `if color == node2color[q]:` increments `color` if it matches the color of `q`.

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Reads `N` and `N-1` pairs of integers from input.
- Constructs graph `G` and edge dictionary `E`.
- Performs BFS starting from vertex `0` to assign colors to edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.
- Prints the maximum number of colors used (`K`).
- Prints the color assigned to each edge in the dictionary `E`.
