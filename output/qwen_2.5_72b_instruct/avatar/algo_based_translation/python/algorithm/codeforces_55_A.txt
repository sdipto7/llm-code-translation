- function signature: main() -> None
- variable declarations: n (int)
- logic flow:
  - read integer input and assign to n
  - while n modulo 2 equals 0:
    - divide n by 2 and assign result to n
  - if n equals 1:
    - print 'YES'
  - else:
    - print 'NO'
- control structures:
  - while loop with condition n % 2 == 0
  - if-else conditional with condition n == 1
- input/output operations:
  - input() reads an integer from user
  - print() outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on condition
- data processing logic:
  - repeatedly divides n by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2
  - checks if the final value of n is 1 to determine output
- required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
  - no additional libraries or modules required
