Function signature: `main()`
Parameters: None
Return type: None

Variable declarations and data types:
- `a`: string

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `prod` from `math`

Execution order and logic flow:

1. Read input from the user.
2. Assign the input value to variable `a`.
3. Check if the count of "1" in `a` is 0.
   - If true, print 0.
   - If false, proceed to the next steps.
4. Strip leading and trailing "0" characters from `a`.
5. Split the resulting string by "1".
6. For each substring `i` in the split result:
   - Count the number of "0" characters in `i` and add 1.
   - Collect these values into a list.
7. Calculate the product of all elements in the list using `prod`.
8. Print the product.
