Function signatures:
- `num_inp() -> int`
- `arr_inp() -> List[int]`
- `sp_inp() -> Iterable[int]`
- `str_inp() -> str`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `x: int`
- `y: int`
- `result: int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read input from standard input, split it into two parts, convert those parts to integers, and assign them to `x` and `y`.
2. Calculate the expression `x + y - 3 + ((y - x) % 3 > 0)`.
3. Use the `max` function to compare the result of the expression with `0`, and assign the larger value to `result`.
4. Print the value of `result`.

Control structures:
- No loops are present.
- Conditional logic is encapsulated within the expression `((y - x) % 3 > 0)`, which evaluates to either `True` (1) or `False` (0).

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input is read from standard input.
- Input is split and converted to integers.
- Arithmetic operations and a comparison are performed on the integers.
- The result of the comparison is used in an arithmetic expression.
- The result of the entire expression is compared with `0` and the larger value is printed.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No specific libraries or modules are required. The code uses built-in Python functions and types.
