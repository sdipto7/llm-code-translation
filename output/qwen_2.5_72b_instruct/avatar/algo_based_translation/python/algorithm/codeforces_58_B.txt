Function signatures with parameter and return types:
- main() -> None

Variable declarations and data types:
- n: int

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to variable n
2. Start a for loop with i ranging from n to 1 (inclusive) in reverse order
3. Inside the loop, check if n is divisible by i (i.e., n % i == 0)
4. If the condition is true, update n to the current value of i and print i followed by a space without a newline

Control structures:
- for loop: for i in range(n, 0, -1)
- if statement: if n % i == 0

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read an integer from the user
- Output: Print the divisors of the input number in descending order, separated by spaces

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules are required
