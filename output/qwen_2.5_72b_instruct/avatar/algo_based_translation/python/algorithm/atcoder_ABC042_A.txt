Function Signature: `main()`
Variable Declarations: `ABC` (Tuple of Integers)
Logic Flow:
1. Read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each split string to an integer, and store the result in `ABC` as a tuple of integers.
2. Check if the count of the integer 5 in `ABC` is equal to 2.
3. If the condition in step 2 is true:
   - Calculate the sum of all integers in `ABC`.
   - If the sum is equal to 17:
     - Print 'YES'.
   - Otherwise:
     - Print 'NO'.
4. If the condition in step 2 is false:
   - Print 'NO'.
Input/Output Operations:
- Input: A line of space-separated integers.
- Output: 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions.
Data Processing Logic: Counting occurrences of an integer in a tuple, calculating the sum of integers in a tuple, and conditional printing.
Libraries/Modules/Dependencies: No additional libraries or modules required.
