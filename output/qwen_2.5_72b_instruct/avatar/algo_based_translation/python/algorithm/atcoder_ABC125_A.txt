Function signature:
- main() -> None

Variable declarations:
- a: int
- b: int
- t: int
- cookie: int
- time: int

Logic flow:
1. Read input values for a, b, and t as integers
2. Initialize cookie to 0
3. Initialize time to a
4. While time is less than or equal to t + 0.5:
   1. Increment cookie by b
   2. Increment time by a
5. Print the value of cookie

Control structures:
- While loop with condition: time <= t + 0.5

Input/output operations:
- Read three integers from standard input
- Print the final value of cookie to standard output

Data processing logic:
- Cumulatively adds b to cookie at intervals of a until the time exceeds t + 0.5

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- None
