Function: main()
Parameters: None
Return Type: None

Variables:
- max_level: integer
- x: list of integers
- y: list of integers
- x: set of integers
- y: set of integers
- z: set of integers

Logic Flow:
1. Read an integer input and assign it to max_level
2. Read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and assign the result to list x
3. Read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and assign the result to list y
4. Remove the first element from list x
5. Remove the first element from list y
6. Convert list x to a set of integers
7. Convert list y to a set of integers
8. If 0 is in set x, remove 0 from set x
9. Otherwise, if 0 is in set y, remove 0 from set y
10. Create a union of sets x and y and assign it to set z
11. If the length of set z is not equal to max_level, print "Oh, my keyboard!"
12. Otherwise, print "I become the guy."

Input/Output Operations:
- Read three lines of input from the user
- Print a string to the output

Data Processing Logic:
- Conversion of input strings to integers
- Removal of elements from lists
- Conversion of lists to sets
- Set operations (union, discard)
- Comparison of set length with an integer

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No specific libraries or modules required
