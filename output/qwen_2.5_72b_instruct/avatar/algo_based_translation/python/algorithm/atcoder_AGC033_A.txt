Function signature: `main()`
Parameters: None
Return type: None

Variable declarations and data types:
- `h`: integer
- `w`: integer
- `graph`: 2D numpy array of floats

Logic flow:
1. Read integers `h` and `w` from input, separated by space.
2. Initialize `graph` as a 2D list of size `h` x `w`. Each element is set to `0` if the corresponding character in the input is `#`; otherwise, it is set to `float('inf')`.
3. Convert `graph` from a 2D list to a 2D numpy array of floats.
4. For each column index `x` from `0` to `w - 2`:
   - Update each element in column `x + 1` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of the element in the same row of column `x` plus `1`.
5. For each column index `x` from `w - 1` to `1`:
   - Update each element in column `x - 1` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of the element in the same row of column `x` plus `1`.
6. For each row index `y` from `0` to `h - 2`:
   - Update each element in row `y + 1` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of the element in the same column of row `y` plus `1`.
7. For each row index `y` from `h - 1` to `1`:
   - Update each element in row `y - 1` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of the element in the same column of row `y` plus `1`.
8. Print the maximum value in `graph` converted to an integer.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads two integers `h` and `w`, followed by `h` lines of strings representing the grid.
- Output: Prints the maximum value in the processed `graph` array after all updates.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `numpy`
