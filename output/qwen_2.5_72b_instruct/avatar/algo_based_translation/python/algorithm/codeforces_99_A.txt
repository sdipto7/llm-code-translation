Function signature: process_input(input_string: str) -> None

Variable declarations and data types:
- input_string: str
- l: List[str]
- s: List[str]
- p: List[str]
- i: int

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read input_string as a string from the user.
2. Split input_string by '.' into l, resulting in a list of two strings.
3. Assign the first element of l to s as a list of characters.
4. Assign the second element of l to p as a list of characters.
5. Convert the first element of p to an integer and assign to i.

Control structures:
- If the last element of s is '9':
    - Print "GOTO Vasilisa."
- Else if the last element of s is not '9' and i is less than 5:
    - Join elements of s into a string.
    - Print the joined string.
- Else:
    - Join elements of s into a string.
    - Convert the joined string to an integer, add 1, and convert back to a string.
    - Print the resulting string.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: A string representing a number with a decimal point.
- Output: A string based on the conditions specified in the control structures.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No specific libraries or modules are required.
