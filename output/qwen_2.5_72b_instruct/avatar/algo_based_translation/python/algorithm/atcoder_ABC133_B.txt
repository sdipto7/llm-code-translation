Algorithm

- Import math library

- Read two integers n and d from input, representing number of points and dimensions
- Declare points as a list of lists of integers, initialized by reading n lines of d integers each from input

- Define function dist with parameters x and y, both lists of integers, and return type float
    - Initialize tmp as float 0.0
    - For i from 0 to d-1, do
        - Add square of (x[i] - y[i]) to tmp
    - Return square root of tmp

- Initialize count as integer 0

- For i from 0 to n-2, do
    - For j from i+1 to n-1, do
        - If dist(points[i], points[j]) is an integer, then
            - Increment count by 1

- Print count
