Function signature: main() -> None
Variable declarations:
n: int
arr: List[float]
arr: List[float] (after list comprehension)
o: int
arr_sum: float
res: int

Logic flow:
1. Read integer n from input
2. Read space-separated floating-point numbers from input, convert to list of floats
3. For each element x in arr, compute x - int(x) and filter out elements where x - int(x) == 0, sort the resulting list
4. Compute o as 2 * n - length of arr
5. Compute arr_sum as sum of elements in arr
6. Initialize res as 2e9 (integer value)
7. For i from 0 to n (inclusive):
    a. If i + o is greater than or equal to n:
        i. Update res as minimum of res and absolute difference between i and arr_sum
8. Print res formatted to three decimal places
