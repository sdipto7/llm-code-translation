Function signature: main()  
Variable declarations:  
n: integer  
m: integer  
q: integer  
r: integer  
a: list of integers  

Logic flow:  
1. Read integer inputs n and m from standard input separated by space.  
2. Calculate q as integer division of n by m.  
3. Calculate r as remainder of n divided by m.  
4. Initialize list a with m elements, each set to q.  
5. Loop for i from 0 to r-1:  
   a[i] = a[i] + 1  
6. Loop for i from 0 to m-1:  
   Print a[i] followed by a space without newline at the end of all prints.  

Input/output operations:  
- Input: Two integers n and m read from standard input.  
- Output: m integers printed to standard output, separated by spaces.  

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:  
None
