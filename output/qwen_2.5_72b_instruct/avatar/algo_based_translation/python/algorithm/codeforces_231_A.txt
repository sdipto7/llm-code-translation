Function: main()
Parameters: None
Return Type: None

Variable Declarations:
n: Integer
c: Integer
i: Integer
l1: List of Integers

Logic Flow:
1. Read integer n from standard input
2. Initialize c to 0
3. For each i from 0 to n-1:
    a. Read a line of input, split by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and store in l1
    b. If the sum of elements in l1 is greater than 1:
        i. Increment c by 1
4. Print the value of c

Control Structures:
- For loop: Iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive)
- If statement: Checks if the sum of elements in l1 is greater than 1

Input/Output Operations:
- Read integer n from standard input
- Read lines of input for each iteration of the loop, process them, and store in l1
- Print the final value of c to standard output

Data Processing Logic:
- Convert input strings to integers and store in a list
- Calculate the sum of the list
- Compare the sum to 1 and update a counter based on the comparison

Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- No specific libraries or modules are required
