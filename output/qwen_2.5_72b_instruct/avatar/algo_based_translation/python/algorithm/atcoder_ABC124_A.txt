Function signature: `main() -> None`

Variable declarations:
- `a`, `b`: integers
- `c`: integer, initialized to 0

Logic flow:
1. Read input values for `a` and `b` as integers separated by space.
2. Initialize `c` to 0.
3. For loop iterates 2 times (`i` ranges from 0 to 1):
   - Add the maximum value between `a` and `b` to `c`.
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, decrement `a` by 1.
   - Otherwise, decrement `b` by 1.
4. Print the value of `c`.

Control structures:
- For loop: Iterates exactly 2 times.
- If-else conditional: Checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

Input/Output operations:
- Input: Reads two space-separated integers from standard input.
- Output: Prints the final value of `c` to standard output.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules required. Uses built-in `input()`, `print()`, `max()`, and `range()` functions.
