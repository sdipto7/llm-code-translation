Function signature: `main() -> None`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `L: list[int]`
- `r: int`
- `k: str`
- `j: str`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Initialize `L` as an empty list of integers.
2. Read a line of input (not used).
3. Initialize `r` to 1.
4. For each `k` in the split input:
   - Append `r` repeated `int(k)` times to `L`.
   - Increment `r` by 1.
5. Read a line of input (not used).
6. For each `j` in the split input:
   - Print the element at index `int(j) - 1` of `L`.

Control structures:
- For loop iterating over `input().split()` for `k`.
- For loop iterating over `input().split()` for `j`.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Read three lines of input, using the second and third lines to construct and query the list `L`.
- Convert string inputs to integers for processing.
- Use zero-based indexing to access elements in `L` based on one-based input values.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries, modules, or dependencies required.
