Function: main()
Parameters: None
Return Type: None

Variable Declarations:
- n: Integer
- r: List of Integers
- ans: Integer

Execution Order and Logic Flow:
1. Input an integer value and assign it to n
2. Input a line of space-separated integers, split the line into individual strings, convert each string to an integer, and store the integers in a list r
3. Initialize ans with the absolute value of the first element of r
4. For i from 1 to n-1 (inclusive):
    a. Calculate the absolute difference between the i-th element of r and the (i-1)-th element of r
    b. Add the result to ans
5. Output the value of ans

Control Structures:
- For loop with range from 1 to n-1

Input/Output Operations:
- Read integer n from standard input
- Read a line of space-separated integers from standard input
- Output the final value of ans to standard output

Data Processing Logic:
- Calculate the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the list r, starting with the absolute value of the first element

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- None
