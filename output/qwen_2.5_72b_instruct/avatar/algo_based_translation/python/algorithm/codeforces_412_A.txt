Function signature: main() -> None

Variable declarations:
- n: int
- k: int
- v: str
- d: List[str]
- f: bool
- m: int
- a: List[str]

Logic flow:
1. Read input values for n and k as integers
2. Read input string v
3. Initialize list d with strings "LEFT" and "RIGHT"
4. Set f to True if k-1 is less than n-k, otherwise False
5. Set m to the minimum of k-1 and n-k
6. Initialize empty list a
7. For loop from 0 to m-1:
   a. Append d[not f] to a
8. For loop through reversed v if f is True, or v as is if f is False:
   a. Append "PRINT " + current character to a
   b. Append d[f] to a
9. Print elements of a except the last element, each on a new line

Input/output operations:
- Read two space-separated integers from input
- Read a single string from input
- Print each element of a except the last one, separated by newlines

Data processing logic:
- Determine the direction based on the position of k relative to the center of n
- Construct a sequence of movements and print commands based on the determined direction and the input string

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required
