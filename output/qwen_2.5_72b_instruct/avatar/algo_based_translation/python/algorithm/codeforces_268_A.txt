Function signature: `main()`
Variable declarations and data types:
- `n`: integer
- `q`: list of lists of strings
- `count`: integer

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read integer `n` from input.
2. Initialize empty list `q`.
3. Initialize integer `count` to 0.
4. For loop over range `n`:
   - Read string from input, split it into a list of strings `a`, and append `a` to `q`.
5. For loop over each element `j` in `q`:
   - For loop over each element `k` in `q`:
     - If `k` is equal to `j`, continue to next iteration.
     - Else if first element of `j` is equal to last element of `k`, increment `count` by 1.
     - Else, continue to next iteration.
6. Print value of `count`.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads integer `n` followed by `n` lines of space-separated strings.
- Output: Prints the integer `count` which represents the number of pairs `(j, k)` where `j` and `k` are different lists in `q` and the first element of `j` matches the last element of `k`.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules required.
