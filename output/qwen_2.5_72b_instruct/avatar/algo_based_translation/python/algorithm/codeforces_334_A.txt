Function Signature:
- Name: main
- Parameters: None
- Return Type: None

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- n: integer
- i: integer
- j: integer

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to n
2. Initialize i to 1
3. Initialize j to n * n
4. Enter a while loop with the condition i < j
5. Inside the loop:
   a. Print the current values of i and j
   b. Increment i by 1
   c. Decrement j by 1
6. Exit the loop when i is no longer less than j

Control Structures:
- While loop with condition i < j

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input: Read an integer from the user
- Output: Print pairs of integers (i, j) until i is no longer less than j

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- None
