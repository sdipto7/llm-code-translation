Function Signature:
- `main()`: No parameters, No return type

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `n`: Integer
- `x`: Integer
- `a`: List of Integers
- `b`: 2D List of Integers, initialized with `None`
- `m`: Integer, used for minimum value calculations

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. Read two integers `n` and `x` from input.
2. Read a list of `n` integers into list `a`.
3. Initialize a 2D list `b` of size `n x n` with `None`.
4. For each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
   - Set `m` to the value of `a[i]`.
   - For each index `j` from `0` to `n-1`:
     - Calculate `k` as `i - j`, and if `k` is less than `0`, add `n` to `k`.
     - Update `m` to be the minimum of `m` and `a[k]`.
     - Set `b[j][i]` to the value of `m`.
5. Initialize `m` to a large value (`10 ** 15`).
6. For each row index `i` and corresponding row `j` in `b`:
   - Update `m` to be the minimum of `m` and the sum of row `j` plus `x * i`.
7. Print the value of `m`.

Control Structures:
- Loop: For `i` from `0` to `n-1`
- Loop: For `j` from `0` to `n-1`
- Conditional: If `k < 0`, then `k += n`
- Loop: For each row index `i` and corresponding row `j` in `b`

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Two integers `n` and `x` on the first line, followed by `n` integers on the second line.
- Output: A single integer, the minimum value of `m`.

Data Processing Logic:
- Populate the 2D list `b` based on the minimum values in a circular manner from list `a`.
- Calculate the minimum sum of each row in `b` adjusted by the index multiplied by `x`.

Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules are required.
