Function signature: main() -> None

Variable declarations and data types:
- n: int
- m: List[List[int]]
- a: List[int]
- i: List[int]

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read integer value from input and assign to n.
2. Initialize matrix m by reading n lines of input, each line containing space-separated integers, converting them to integers and storing them as rows in m.
3. Sort matrix m in descending order based on the first element of each row.
4. Assign the first row of m to a.
5. For each subsequent row i in m starting from the second row:
   a. If the second element of i is greater than the second element of a, print 'Happy Alex' and terminate the loop.
   b. Otherwise, assign i to a.
6. If the loop completes without printing 'Happy Alex', print 'Poor Alex'.

Control structures:
- For loop: Iterates over each row i in m starting from the second row.
- If conditional: Checks if the second element of i is greater than the second element of a.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input operations: Reads integer value for n and n lines of space-separated integers to populate matrix m.
- Output operations: Prints 'Happy Alex' if a row with a second element greater than the current maximum is found; otherwise, prints 'Poor Alex'.
- Data processing logic: Sorts matrix m in descending order and iteratively compares the second elements of consecutive rows.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No external libraries, modules, or dependencies are required.
