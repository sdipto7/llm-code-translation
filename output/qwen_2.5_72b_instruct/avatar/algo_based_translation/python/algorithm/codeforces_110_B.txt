Function signature: `main() -> None`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `LUCKY: str`
- `n: int`
- `s: str`
- `i: int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Assign the string "abcd" to the variable `LUCKY`.
2. Read an integer from standard input and assign it to the variable `n`.
3. Initialize an empty string and assign it to the variable `s`.
4. For each integer `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive):
   - Append the character at index `i % 4` of the string `LUCKY` to the string `s`.
5. Print the string `s`.

Control structures:
- For loop with the condition `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read an integer `n` from standard input.
- Output: Print the string `s` after constructing it by repeating characters from `LUCKY`.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules are required.
