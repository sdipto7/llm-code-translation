Function signature: `calculate_min_operations(s: List[str]) -> int`
Variable declarations and data types: 
- `s: List[str]` (input string converted to list of characters)
- `even: Counter` (counter for characters at even indices)
- `odd: Counter` (counter for characters at odd indices)

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Convert input string to list of characters: `s = list(input())`
2. Count characters at even indices: `even = collections.Counter(s[0::2])`
3. Count characters at odd indices: `odd = collections.Counter(s[1::2])`
4. Calculate minimum operations needed to make the sequence alternating:
   - `min_operations_1 = len(s) - (even["0"] + odd["1"])`
   - `min_operations_2 = len(s) - (even["1"] + odd["0"])`
5. Return the minimum of the two calculated operations: `print(min(min_operations_1, min_operations_2))`

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `collections` module for `Counter` class
