Function Signature:
- `main()`: No parameters, No return type

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `n`: Integer
- `m`: Integer
- `round_complexity`: List of Integers
- `george_complexity`: List of Integers
- `i`: Integer, initialized to 0
- `j`: Integer, initialized to 0

Execution Order and Logic Flow:
1. Read two integers `n` and `m` from input, separated by spaces.
2. Read `n` integers for `round_complexity` list from input, separated by spaces.
3. Read `m` integers for `george_complexity` list from input, separated by spaces.
4. Initialize `i` and `j` to 0.
5. Enter a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than `n` and `j` is less than `m`.
6. Inside the loop, check if `round_complexity[i]` is less than or equal to `george_complexity[j]`.
   - If true, increment `i` by 1.
7. Always increment `j` by 1.
8. After the loop, print the result of `n - i`.

Control Structures:
- While loop with condition `i < n and j < m`
- Conditional inside the loop: `if round_complexity[i] <= george_complexity[j]`

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Three lines from standard input
  - First line: Two integers `n` and `m`
  - Second line: `n` integers for `round_complexity`
  - Third line: `m` integers for `george_complexity`
- Output: One integer, result of `n - i`, printed to standard output

Data Processing Logic:
- Compare elements of `round_complexity` and `george_complexity` lists.
- Count how many elements in `round_complexity` can be "matched" with elements in `george_complexity` in order.
- Calculate the number of unmatched elements in `round_complexity`.
