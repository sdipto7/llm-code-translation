Function signature: main() -> None

Variable declarations:
- n: int
- m: int
- sa: int
- ss: List[str]

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read space-separated integers n and m from input and convert them to int.
2. Read a string from input, count the number of '-' characters, and assign it to sa.
3. Update sa to be the minimum of (n - sa) and sa.
4. Initialize an empty list ss to store output strings.
5. For _ in range(m):
   - Read space-separated integers a and b from input and convert them to int.
   - Subtract a from b and update b with the result.
   - Calculate the expression (b % 2 and b <= sa << 1).
   - If the expression is True, append "1\n" to ss, otherwise append "0\n" to ss.
6. Join all elements in ss into a single string and print it.

Control structures:
- For loop: for _ in range(m)
- Conditional expression: (b % 2 and b <= sa << 1) and "1\n" or "0\n"

Input/output operations:
- Read input using input() and process it to extract integers n, m, and subsequent a, b pairs.
- Write output to stdout by joining elements of ss and printing the result.

Data processing logic:
- Count '-' characters in the second input line to determine sa.
- Adjust sa to be the minimum of (n - sa) and sa.
- For each pair of a, b, calculate b - a and check if the resulting b is odd and less than or equal to 2 * sa.
- Based on the check, append either "1\n" or "0\n" to the list ss.
- Finally, concatenate all strings in ss to form the output.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
