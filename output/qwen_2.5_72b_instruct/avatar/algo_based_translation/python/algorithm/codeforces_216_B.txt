Function signatures:
- `readInts() -> map[int]`
- `dfs(g: dict[int, set[int]], seen: set[int], i: int) -> tuple[int, int]`
- `solve() -> bool`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `line0: list[int]`
- `n: int`
- `m: int`
- `g: dict[int, set[int]]`
- `seen: set[int]`
- `nodes: int`
- `edges: int`
- `a: int`
- `b: int`
- `ans: int`
- `x: int`
- `y: int`

Logic flow and control structures:
- `readInts()` reads a line of input, splits it into strings, converts each to an integer, and returns the result as a map of integers.
- `solve()` function:
  - Initializes `line0` as an empty list.
  - Attempts to read input into `line0` using `readInts()`, catching `EOFError` to return `False`.
  - Assigns the first two integers from `line0` to `n` and `m`.
  - Initializes `g` as a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` and empty sets as values.
  - Initializes `seen` as an empty set.
  - For each edge (from 1 to `m`), reads two integers `a` and `b`, and adds `b` to the set in `g` at key `a`, and `a` to the set in `g` at key `b`.
  - Initializes `ans` to 0.
  - For each node from 1 to `n`, if the node is not in `seen`, performs a depth-first search (`dfs`) starting from that node.
  - `dfs(g, seen, i)`:
    - If `i` is in `seen`, returns `(0, 0)`.
    - Adds `i` to `seen`.
    - Initializes `nodes` to 1 and `edges` to the number of elements in the set `g[i]`.
    - For each element `j` in `g[i]`, recursively calls `dfs(g, seen, j)` and adds the results to `nodes` and `edges`.
    - Returns `(nodes, edges)`.
  - After `dfs`, if `nodes` is greater than 1, odd, and `2 * nodes` equals `edges`, increments `ans`.
  - After checking all nodes, if `(n - ans)` is odd, increments `ans`.
  - Prints `ans`.
  - Returns `True`.

Input/output operations:
- Reads input from standard input.
- Prints output to standard output.

Data processing logic:
- Reads graph data and processes it to determine the number of connected components that are odd cycles.
- Uses depth-first search to explore each component of the graph.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No specific libraries or modules are required. Uses built-in Python functions and data structures.
