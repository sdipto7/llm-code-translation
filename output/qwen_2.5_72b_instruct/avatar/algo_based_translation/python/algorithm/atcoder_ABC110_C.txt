Function: run(s: str, t: str) -> str
Variable Declarations:
- ss: List[int] (sorted list of character counts in string s)
- tt: List[int] (sorted list of character counts in string t)
Logic Flow:
1. Count the frequency of each character in string s using collections.Counter(s) and convert to a list of values.
2. Sort the list of character counts from step 1 and assign to ss.
3. Count the frequency of each character in string t using collections.Counter(t) and convert to a list of values.
4. Sort the list of character counts from step 3 and assign to tt.
5. Compare ss and tt.
6. If ss is equal to tt, return 'Yes'.
7. Otherwise, return 'No'.

Function: main() -> None
Variable Declarations:
- s: str (input string)
- t: str (input string)
Logic Flow:
1. Read input string s from the user.
2. Read input string t from the user.
3. Call run(s, t) and print the result.

Required Libraries/Modules:
- collections (for collections.Counter)
