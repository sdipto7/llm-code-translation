Function Signature: `main() -> None`

Variable Declarations:
- `princess: int`
- `dragon: int`
- `t: int`
- `f: int`
- `c: int`
- `result: int`
- `position: float`

Logic Flow:
1. Input `princess` as integer
2. Input `dragon` as integer
3. Input `t` as integer
4. Input `f` as integer
5. Input `c` as integer
6. If `dragon` is less than or equal to `princess`:
   - Print `0`
   - Exit program
7. Set `result` to `0`
8. Set `position` to `t * princess`
9. Update `position` by adding `princess * position / (dragon - princess)`
10. While `position` is less than `c`:
    - Increment `result` by `1`
    - Update `position` by adding `princess * position / dragon`
    - Update `position` by adding `princess * f`
    - Update `position` by adding `princess * position / (dragon - princess)`
11. Print `result`

Input/Output Operations:
- Read 5 integers from standard input
- Print an integer to standard output

Data Processing Logic:
- Calculate initial `position` based on `t`, `princess`, and `dragon`
- Use a loop to iteratively update `position` and increment `result` until `position` reaches or exceeds `c`
- Handle special case where `dragon` is not greater than `princess` by immediately exiting with `result` of `0`
