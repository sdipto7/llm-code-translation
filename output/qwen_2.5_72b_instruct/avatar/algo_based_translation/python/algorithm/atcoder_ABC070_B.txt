- Function signature: `main()` with no parameters and no return type
- Variable declarations and data types: `A` as a list of integers
- Logic flow in execution order:
  1. Read input from standard input, split by spaces, convert each element to integer, and store in list `A`
  2. Check if `A[1]` is less than or equal to `A[2]` or if `A[3]` is less than or equal to `A[0]`
  3. If condition is true, print `0`
  4. If condition is false, sort list `A` in ascending order
  5. Print the difference between the third and second elements of sorted list `A`
- Control structures:
  - Conditional: `if A[1] <= A[2] or A[3] <= A[0]:` and `else:`
- Input/output operations and data processing logic:
  - Input: Read a line from standard input, split into substrings, convert each substring to an integer, and store in list `A`
  - Output: Print `0` if condition is met, otherwise print the difference between the third and second elements of sorted list `A`
- Required libraries, modules, or dependencies: No specific imports required
