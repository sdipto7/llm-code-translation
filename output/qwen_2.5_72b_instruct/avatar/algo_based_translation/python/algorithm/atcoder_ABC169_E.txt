Function signature: 
- `resolve()` with no parameters and no return type

Variable declarations and data types:
- `n` as integer
- `low` as list of integers
- `high` as list of integers
- `a` as integer
- `b` as integer
- `hh` as float
- `ll` as float

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Input `n` as integer from standard input
2. Initialize empty lists `low` and `high`
3. For loop iterating `n` times:
   - Read two integers `a` and `b` from standard input
   - Append `a` to `low`
   - Append `b` to `high`
4. Sort `low` in ascending order
5. Sort `high` in ascending order
6. If `n` is odd:
   - Calculate result as `high[(n + 1) // 2 - 1] - low[(n + 1) // 2 - 1] + 1`
   - Print result
7. Else:
   - Calculate `hh` as `(high[n // 2 - 1] + high[n // 2]) / 2`
   - Calculate `ll` as `(low[n // 2 - 1] + low[n // 2]) / 2`
   - Calculate result as `int((hh - ll) * 2) + 1`
   - Print result

Control structures:
- For loop from 0 to `n-1`
- If-else statement to check if `n` is odd or even

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Read integer `n` from standard input
- Read pairs of integers `a` and `b` from standard input in a loop
- Sort lists `low` and `high`
- Calculate and print the result based on whether `n` is odd or even

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules required
