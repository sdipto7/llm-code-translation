Function: main()
Parameters: None
Return Type: None
Variables:
- n (int)
- s (int)
- c (int)
- f (int)
- t (int)
- x (int)

1. Import sys module
2. Read input using sys.stdin.readline and split into two integers, assign to n and s
3. Initialize c to 0
4. For loop runs n times:
    a. Read input using sys.stdin.readline and split into two integers, assign to f and t
    b. Calculate x as t - (s - f)
    c. If x is greater than c:
        i. Set c to x
5. Print the value of s + c
