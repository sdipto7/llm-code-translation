Function Signature: `main()`
Parameter Types: None
Return Type: None

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `p`: List of strings
- `x1, y1, x2, y2`: Integers
- `DIF1, DIF2`: Integers
- `x3, y3, x4, y4`: Integers

Execution Order:
1. Read input as a single line string and split by space to form list `p`.
2. Convert first element of `p` to integer and assign to `x1`.
3. Convert second element of `p` to integer and assign to `y1`.
4. Convert third element of `p` to integer and assign to `x2`.
5. Convert fourth element of `p` to integer and assign to `y2`.
6. Calculate difference between `x2` and `x1` and assign to `DIF1`.
7. Calculate difference between `y2` and `y1` and assign to `DIF2`.
8. Calculate `x3` as `x2 - DIF2`.
9. Calculate `y3` as `y2 + DIF1`.
10. Calculate `x4` as `x1 - DIF2`.
11. Calculate `y4` as `y1 + DIF1`.
12. Print `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` separated by spaces.

Control Structures:
- No loops or conditionals present.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read a single line of space-separated integers.
- Output: Print four space-separated integers.

Data Processing Logic:
- Reads coordinates of two points.
- Computes coordinates of two additional points forming a parallelogram with the input points.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules required.
