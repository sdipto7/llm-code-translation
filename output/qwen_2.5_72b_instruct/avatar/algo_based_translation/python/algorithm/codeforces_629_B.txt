- Function signatures: main() -> None
- Variable declarations and data types: 
  - N: int = 368
  - m: list[int] = [0] * N
  - f: list[int] = [0] * N
  - x: str
  - a: int
  - b: int
  - i: int
  - a: int = 0
  - b: int = 0
  - c: int = 0
- Logic flow in execution order:
  1. Read an integer from input and assign it to i
  2. For each iteration in the range of i:
     1. Read a line from input, strip the newline character, split by spaces, and assign the first element to x, the second to a, and the third to b
     2. Convert a and b to integers, then increment b by 1
     3. If x equals 'M':
        1. Increment m[a] by 2
        2. Decrement m[b] by 2
     4. Else:
        1. Increment f[a] by 2
        2. Decrement f[b] by 2
  3. For each iteration in the range of N:
     1. Increment a by m[i]
     2. Increment b by f[i]
     3. If the minimum of a and b is greater than c:
        1. Assign the minimum of a and b to c
  4. Print c
- Control structures:
  - For loop: for i in range(int(input()))
  - For loop: for i in range(N)
  - If-Else: if x == 'M': ... else: ...
- Input/output operations and data processing logic:
  - Read an integer from input
  - Read lines from input, split and convert data
  - Process data to update lists m and f
  - Calculate the maximum minimum value of a and b
  - Print the result
- Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
  - sys module for input operation
