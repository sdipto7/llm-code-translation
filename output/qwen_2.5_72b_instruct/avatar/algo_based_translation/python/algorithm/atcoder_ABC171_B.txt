Function signature with parameter and return types:
- Function name: main
- Parameters: None
- Return type: None

Variable declarations and data types:
- n: int
- k: int
- numbers: List[int]

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read a single line of input containing two space-separated integers, n and k.
2. Convert the input string into a list of integers and assign it to the variable numbers.
3. Sort the list numbers in ascending order.
4. Slice the first k elements from the sorted list numbers.
5. Calculate the sum of the sliced list.
6. Print the calculated sum.

Control structures:
- No explicit loops or conditionals are present in the code.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
1. Input: A single line of input containing two space-separated integers.
2. Output: A single integer representing the sum of the smallest k integers from the input list.
3. Data processing:
   - Convert input string to list of integers.
   - Sort the list.
   - Slice the list to get the first k elements.
   - Sum the sliced list.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries, modules, or dependencies are required.
