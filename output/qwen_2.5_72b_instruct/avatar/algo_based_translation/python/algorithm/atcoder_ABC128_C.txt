Function signature: `main()`
- No parameters or return type specified

Variable declarations and data types:
- `n`, `m`: integers
- `li`: list of lists of integers
- `p`: tuple of integers
- `q`: set of integers
- `r`: set of integers
- `v`: set of integers
- `ans`: integer
- `i`: integer
- `s`: set of integers
- `u`: list of integers
- `w`: integer

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Import `itertools` module
2. Read `n`, `m` as integers from input and split by space
3. Read `m` lines of input, convert each line to a list of integers, discard the first element, and store in `li`
4. Read a line of input, convert to a tuple of integers, and store in `p`
5. Create set `q` containing all unique elements from the flattened list of `li`
6. Create set `r` containing integers from 1 to `n`
7. Compute set `v` as the difference between `r` and `q`
8. Initialize `ans` to 0
9. Loop over `i` from 0 to length of `q` inclusive:
   - Loop over all combinations `s` of length `i` from set `q`:
      - Convert `s` to a set
      - Loop over each pair `(u, w)` from `li` and `p`:
         - If the length of the intersection of `s` and `u` modulo 2 is not equal to `w`, break the loop
      - If the inner loop completes without breaking, increment `ans` by 2 raised to the power of the length of `v`
10. Print `ans`
