Function Signature: `calculate_time_difference() -> None`

Variable Declarations:
- `h1: int`
- `m1: int`
- `h2: int`
- `m2: int`

Logic Flow:
1. Read input as a string and split by ':' to get two parts. Convert both parts to integers and assign to `h1` and `m1` respectively.
2. Convert `h1` hours to minutes and add to `m1`.
3. Read another input as a string and split by ':' to get two parts. Convert both parts to integers and assign to `h2` and `m2` respectively.
4. Convert `h2` hours to minutes and add to `m2`.
5. Subtract `m2` from `m1` and update `m2` with the result.
6. Calculate `m2` modulo 1440 and update `m2` with the result.
7. Calculate hours by integer division of `m2` by 60.
8. Calculate minutes by modulo operation of `m2` by 60.
9. Print the result in the format "HH:MM" where HH is zero-padded to two digits and MM is zero-padded to two digits.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Two time strings in "HH:MM" format.
- Output: A time string in "HH:MM" format representing the difference between the two input times, modulo 24 hours.

Data Processing Logic:
- Convert times from "HH:MM" format to total minutes since midnight.
- Calculate the difference between the two times.
- Handle the case where the second time is later than the first by using modulo 1440.
- Convert the difference back to "HH:MM" format for output.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required.
