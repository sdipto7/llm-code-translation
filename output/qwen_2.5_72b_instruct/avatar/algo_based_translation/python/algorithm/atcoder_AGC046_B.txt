Function: main()  
Parameters: None  
Return Type: None  

Variable Declarations:  
A: Integer  
B: Integer  
C: Integer  
D: Integer  
m: Integer = 998244353  
d: 2D List of Integers, size (C+1) x (D+1), initialized to 0  

Logic Flow:  
1. Read four integers A, B, C, D from standard input, separated by spaces.
2. Initialize a 2D list d with dimensions (C+1) x (D+1) where each element is set to 0.
3. Set d[A][B] to 1.
4. For each integer i from A to C (inclusive):
   a. For each integer j from B to D (inclusive):
      i. Update d[i][j] by adding the value of (d[i][j-1] * i + d[i-1][j] * j - d[i-1][j-1] * (i-1) * (j-1)) modulo m to it.
5. Print the value of d[C][D] to standard output.

Input/Output Operations:  
- Read four integers from standard input.
- Print one integer (d[C][D]) to standard output.

Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:  
- None required beyond standard Python capabilities.
