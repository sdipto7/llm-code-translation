Function Signature: `main()`  
Parameters: none  
Return Type: none  

Variable Declarations:  
`n: int`  
`s: defaultdict(int)`  
`l: List[str]`  
`f: str`  
`i: int`  
`v: str`  

Logic Flow:  
- Read integer `n` from input  
- Initialize `s` as a defaultdict with default value 0  
- Initialize `l` as a list by reading `n` strings from input  
- Set `f` to 'Yes'  
- Set `i` to -1  
- For each string `v` in `l`:  
    - Increment count of `v` in `s` by 1  
    - If count of `v` in `s` is greater than or equal to 2:  
        - Set `f` to 'No'  
    - If `i` is not -1 and last character of `l[i]` is not equal to first character of `v`:  
        - Set `f` to 'No'  
    - Increment `i` by 1  
- Print `f`

Input/Output Operations:  
- Read integer `n` from standard input  
- Read `n` strings from standard input  
- Print string `f` to standard output  

Data Processing Logic:  
- Count occurrences of each string using defaultdict  
- Check if any string appears more than once  
- Verify if last character of previous string matches first character of current string
