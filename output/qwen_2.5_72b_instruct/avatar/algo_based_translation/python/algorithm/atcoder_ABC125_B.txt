Function Signature:
- `main() -> None`

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `N: int`
- `V: List[int]`
- `C: List[int]`
- `list: List[int]`
- `ans: int`
- `X: int`
- `Y: int`
- `i: int`

Logic Flow in Execution Order:

1. Read an integer `N` from standard input.
2. Read a string from standard input, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and store the result in list `V`.
3. Read another string from standard input, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and store the result in list `C`.
4. Initialize list `list` with a single element `0`.
5. Initialize integers `ans`, `X`, and `Y` to `0`.
6. For each index `i` from `0` to `N-1`:
   - If the difference between `V[i]` and `C[i]` is greater than `0`:
     - Assign `V[i]` to `X`.
     - Assign `C[i]` to `Y`.
     - Append the difference `X - Y` to list `list`.
7. Print the sum of all elements in list `list`.

Control Structures:
- Loop: `for i in range(N)`
- Conditional: `if V[i] - C[i] > 0`

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input: Three inputs from the standard input - an integer `N`, a space-separated string of integers which is converted to list `V`, and another space-separated string of integers which is converted to list `C`.
- Output: The sum of the elements in list `list` is printed to the standard output.
- Data Processing: The code calculates the difference between corresponding elements of lists `V` and `C` and accumulates the positive differences in list `list`.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- `List` from `typing` module (implied usage as list type)
