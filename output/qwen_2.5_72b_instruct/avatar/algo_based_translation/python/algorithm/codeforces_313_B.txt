Function signature:
- main() -> None

Variable declarations and data types:
- soz: str
- a: List[int]
- n: int
- arr: List[int]
- i: int
- m: str
- l: str

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Input soz as a string
2. Initialize list a with length len(soz) + 1 filled with zeros
3. For i from 1 to len(soz) - 1:
   - Set a[i] to a[i - 1]
   - If soz[i - 1] equals soz[i]:
     - Increment a[i] by 1
4. Input n as an integer
5. Initialize empty list arr
6. For i from 0 to n - 1:
   - Split input into strings m and l
   - Append a[int(l) - 1] - a[int(m) - 1] to arr
7. For each element i in arr:
   - Print i

Control structures:
- For loop with range(1, len(soz)) for processing soz
- If condition checking if consecutive characters in soz are equal
- For loop with range(n) for processing queries
- For loop iterating over elements in arr for printing results

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Read soz from standard input
- Read n from standard input
- For each query, read two space-separated values m and l
- Compute the difference in counts between indices l and m in list a
- Print each result from arr

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required
