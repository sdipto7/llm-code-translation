Function Signature: 
main()

Variable Declarations:
n: int
m: int
b: List[int]
i: int
r: int
c: int

Logic Flow:
1. Read input values for n and m as integers.
2. Initialize list b with 2*n elements, all set to 1.
3. Set elements b[0], b[n-1], b[n], and b[2*n-1] to 0.
4. For i from 0 to m-1:
    a. Read input values for r and c as integers.
    b. Set elements b[r-1] and b[n+c-1] to 0.
5. If n is odd and both b[n//2] and b[n+n//2] are non-zero, set b[n//2] to 0.
6. Print the sum of all elements in list b.

Control Structures:
- Loop: for i in range(m)
- Conditionals: 
    - if n % 2 and b[n // 2] and b[n + n // 2]

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read space-separated integers for n and m, then for each of m lines, read space-separated integers for r and c.
- Output: Print a single integer representing the sum of the list b.

Data Processing Logic:
- Initialize and modify the list b based on input values.
- Apply special conditions if n is odd.
- Calculate and output the sum of the modified list.

Required Libraries:
- No external libraries or modules required.
