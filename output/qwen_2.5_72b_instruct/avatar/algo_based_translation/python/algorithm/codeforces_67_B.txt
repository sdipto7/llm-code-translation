Function signature:  
main() -> None  

Variable declarations and data types:  
u: function  
n: int  
k: int  
M: list of int  
m: int  
j: int  
p: int  
l: int  

Logic flow in execution order:  
1. u is assigned the built-in input function  
2. Read a line of input, split it into two integers, assign them to n and k respectively  
3. Read another line of input, split it into a list of integers, assign this list to M  
4. Initialize m to 0  
5. For each value of j from 0 to n-1:  
   a. For each value of p from 0 to n-1:  
      i. If M[p] is 0:  
         1. Print p+1 followed by a space without newline  
         2. Break out of the inner loop  
   b. For each value of l from 0 to p-k (inclusive):  
      i. Decrement M[l] by 1  
   c. Decrement M[p] by 1  

Input/output operations and data processing logic:  
- Input: Two lines of text. The first line contains two integers n and k. The second line contains n integers representing the list M.  
- Output: A single line containing space-separated integers representing the indices (1-based) where elements in M become zero.  
- Data processing involves reading input, updating elements of list M based on specific conditions, and printing the result.  

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
