Function signature: `main_function()` with no parameters and no return type

Variable declarations:
- `n` as integer
- `a` as list of integers
- `current_level` as integer initialized to 0
- `counter` as integer initialized to 0
- `counter_turns` as integer initialized to -1

Logic flow:
1. Read integer `n` from input
2. Read space-separated string of integers, convert each to integer, and store in list `a`
3. Initialize `current_level` to 0
4. Initialize `counter` to 0
5. Initialize `counter_turns` to -1
6. Enter while loop with condition `counter < len(a)`
   - Increment `counter_turns` by 1
   - Enter for loop with index `i` ranging from 0 to `len(a) - 1`
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to -1 and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `counter`
       - Increment `counter` by 1
       - Set `a[i]` to -1
   - Reverse list `a`
7. Print value of `counter_turns`

Input/output operations:
- Read an integer `n` from standard input
- Read a space-separated string of integers from standard input
- Print the integer value of `counter_turns` to standard output

Data processing logic:
- The algorithm processes a list of integers, marking elements as processed by setting them to -1, and counts the number of "turns" required to process all elements in the list based on a condition that the element's value must be less than or equal to a counter.
