- Function signature: `main()`
- Variable declarations and data types:
  - `menu`: List of Lists (int, int)
  - `m`: str
  - `e`: int
  - `ans`: int
- Logic flow in execution order:
  - Initialize `menu` as an empty list
  - For loop runs 5 times:
    - Read input and assign to `m`
    - Extract the last character of `m`, convert to int, and assign to `e`
    - If `e` is equal to 0, set `e` to 10
    - Append a list containing the integer conversion of `m` and `e` to `menu`
  - Sort `menu` based on the second element of each sublist
  - Initialize `ans` to 0
  - For loop iterates over `menu` starting from the second element:
    - Add the result of `math.ceil(m[0] / 10) * 10` to `ans`
  - Print the result of `ans + menu[0][0]`
- Control structures:
  - For loop runs 5 times
  - If condition checks if `e` is equal to 0
  - For loop iterates over `menu` starting from the second element
- Input/output operations:
  - Reads input 5 times
  - Prints the final result
- Data processing logic:
  - Extracts and processes the last digit of the input
  - Sorts the menu based on the processed last digit
  - Calculates the sum of processed menu values except the first one
  - Adds the first menu value to the final sum
- Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
  - `math` module for `math.ceil` function
