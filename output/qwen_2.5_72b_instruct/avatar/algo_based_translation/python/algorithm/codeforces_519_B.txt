Function signature: 
- `main()` -> None

Variable declarations and data types:
- `n` -> int
- `a` -> list[int]
- `b` -> list[int]
- `c` -> list[int]
- `x` -> int
- `y` -> int
- `z` -> int
- `i` -> int (loop variable)

Logic flow:
1. Read an integer `n` from input.
2. Read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each split string to an integer, and store the resulting list in `a`.
3. Read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each split string to an integer, and store the resulting list in `b`.
4. Read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each split string to an integer, and store the resulting list in `c`.
5. Initialize `x` to 0.
6. For each integer `i` in list `a`:
   - Add `i` to `x`.
7. Initialize `y` to 0.
8. For each integer `i` in list `b`:
   - Add `i` to `y`.
9. Initialize `z` to 0.
10. For each integer `i` in list `c`:
    - Add `i` to `z`.
11. Print the absolute difference between `x` and `y`.
12. Print the absolute difference between `y` and `z`.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input is read from standard input in the form of integers.
- Output is written to standard output as integers representing absolute differences.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No specific libraries or modules required.
