Function Signature:
- main() -> None

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- stdin: str
- s: str
- result: str

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. Call input() function to read a string from standard input and assign it to stdin
2. Assign value of stdin to s
3. Check if "A" is in s and if "B" is in s
   - If both conditions are true, assign "Yes" to result
   - Otherwise, assign "No" to result
4. Print the value of result
