Function signature:
- `main() -> None`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `candeleIntere: int`
- `b: int`
- `s: int`
- `restoSciolte: int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Import the `re` module
2. Read a line of input, split it into two integers, and assign them to `candeleIntere` and `b`
3. Initialize `s` to 0
4. Initialize `restoSciolte` to 0
5. Enter a while loop that continues as long as `candeleIntere` is greater than 0 or `restoSciolte` is greater than or equal to `b`
6. Inside the loop:
   - Add the integer division of `restoSciolte` by `b` to `candeleIntere`
   - Update `restoSciolte` to the remainder of `restoSciolte` divided by `b`
   - Add `candeleIntere` to `s`
   - Add the remainder of `candeleIntere` divided by `b` to `restoSciolte`
   - Update `candeleIntere` to the integer division of `candeleIntere` by `b`
7. After the loop, print the value of `s`

Control structures:
- While loop with condition `candeleIntere > 0 or restoSciolte >= b`

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: A single line containing two space-separated integers
- Output: A single integer representing the total count

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `re` module (though not used in the provided code)
