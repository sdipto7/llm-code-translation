Function signature: main() -> None
Variable declarations and data types:
- N: int
- A: List[int]
- mn: int
- mx: int

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read integer N from input
2. Read space-separated integers from input, convert to list of integers A
3. Initialize mn to N + 1
4. Initialize mx to -1
5. Loop over range N with index i:
   a. If i + 1 is not equal to A[i]:
      i. Update mn to minimum of mn and i
      ii. Update mx to maximum of mx and i
6. If mx is equal to -1:
   a. Print '0 0'
7. Else:
   a. Reverse sublist of A from index mn to mx inclusive
   b. Check if reversed sublist combined with other parts of A is sorted:
      i. If true:
         1. Print mn + 1 and mx + 1
      ii. Else:
         1. Print '0 0'

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read integer N and list of integers A
- Output: Print two integers representing indices or '0 0' if conditions are not met
- Data processing: Determine indices mn and mx where elements do not match their positions, reverse sublist, check if entire list becomes sorted
