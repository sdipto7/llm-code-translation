function signature: main() -> None

variable declarations:
n: int
k: int
x: int

logic flow:
1. read input and split into two integers, assign to n and k
2. initialize x to 0
3. if k is less than or equal to the maximum of n^2 // 2 and n^2 - (n^2 // 2):
   3.1 print 'YES'
   3.2 for i from 0 to n-1:
       3.2.1 for j from 0 to n-1:
           3.2.1.1 if i modulo 2 is equal to j modulo 2 and x is less than k:
               3.2.1.1.1 print 'L' without newline
               3.2.1.1.2 increment x by 1
           3.2.1.2 else:
               3.2.1.2.1 print 'S' without newline
       3.2.2 print newline
4. else:
   4.1 print 'NO'

input/output operations:
- read input from standard input
- print to standard output

data processing logic:
- calculate n^2 // 2
- calculate n^2 - (n^2 // 2)
- compare k with the maximum of the two calculated values
- use nested loops to iterate over a grid of size n x n
- use conditional logic to determine whether to print 'L' or 'S' based on the parity of indices and the value of x

required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- no additional libraries required
