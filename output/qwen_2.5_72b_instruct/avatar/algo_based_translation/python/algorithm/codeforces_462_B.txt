Function signatures with parameter and return types:
- function main() -> None

Variable declarations and data types:
- n: int
- k: int
- s: str
- count: List[int] (size 26, initialized to 0)
- c: str
- res: int (initialized to 0)
- i: int

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read n and k as integers from input, separated by space.
2. Read string s from input.
3. Initialize count as a list of 26 zeros.
4. For each character c in string s:
   - Increment count[ord(c) - ord("A")] by 1.
5. Sort count in descending order.
6. Initialize res to 0.
7. For i from 0 to 25:
   - If count[i] is greater than or equal to k:
     - Add k * k to res.
     - Print res.
     - Exit the program.
   - Otherwise:
     - Subtract count[i] from k.
     - Add count[i] ** 2 to res.
8. Print res.

Control structures:
- Loops:
  - For loop: for c in s
  - For loop: for i in range(26)
- Conditionals:
  - If condition: if count[i] >= k

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Read two integers from input.
- Read a string from input.
- Process the string to count occurrences of each letter.
- Sort the counts in descending order.
- Calculate the result based on the given conditions.
- Print the result.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- None required
