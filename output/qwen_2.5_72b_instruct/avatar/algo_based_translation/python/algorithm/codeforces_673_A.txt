Function signature:
- Function name: main
- Parameters: None
- Return type: None

Variable declarations and data types:
- n: int
- arr: list of int
- i: int

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read an integer n from input.
2. Read a space-separated string of integers from input, convert it to a list of integers, and assign it to arr.
3. If the first element of arr is greater than 15, print 15 and exit.
4. Else, iterate over arr starting from the second element:
    - For each element at index i, check if the difference between arr[i] and arr[i-1] is greater than 15.
        - If true, print arr[i-1] + 15 and exit loop.
5. If loop completes without printing, check if the last element of arr is equal to 90 or if arr[-1] + 15 is greater than or equal to 90.
    - If true, print 90.
    - Else, print arr[-1] + 15.

Control structures:
- If statement: 
    - Condition: arr[0] > 15
- For loop:
    - Range: 1 to len(arr)
    - If statement inside loop:
        - Condition: arr[i] - arr[i-1] > 15
        - Action: print(arr[i-1] + 15) and break
- Else clause after loop:
    - If statement:
        - Condition: arr[-1] == 90 or arr[-1] + 15 >= 90
        - Action: print(90)
    - Else clause:
        - Action: print(arr[-1] + 15)

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads an integer n and a space-separated list of integers.
- Output: Prints an integer based on specified conditions.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- None
