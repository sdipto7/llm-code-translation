Algorithm:
- Function: main()
  - Parameters: None
  - Return Type: None
- Variable Declarations:
  - n: int
  - num: int
  - num_set: set of int
  - two_times_set: set of int
  - i: int
  - j: int
  - num_list: list of int
  - lcm: int
- Logic Flow:
  - Read two integers n and num from input
  - Read a set of integers num_set from input
  - Initialize an empty set two_times_set
  - For each integer i in num_set:
    - For each integer j from 1 to 29:
      - Integer divide i by 2
      - If i is odd:
        - Add j to two_times_set
        - Break the inner loop
    - If the length of two_times_set is not equal to 1:
      - Print 0
      - Break the outer loop
  - Else:
    - Convert num_set to a list num_list
    - Initialize lcm with the first element of num_list
    - For each integer i from 1 to length of num_list - 1:
      - Update lcm as the least common multiple of lcm and num_list[i]
    - Print the result of (num - lcm // 2) // lcm + 1
- Control Structures:
  - For loop over num_set
  - For loop over range(1, 30)
  - If statement to check if i is odd
  - If statement to check if the length of two_times_set is not equal to 1
- Input/Output Operations:
  - Read two integers from input
  - Read a set of integers from input
  - Print an integer as output
- Data Processing Logic:
  - Check the number of times elements in num_set can be divided by 2 before becoming odd
  - Calculate the least common multiple of elements in num_set
  - Compute the final result based on the least common multiple and the input value num
- Required Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
  - fractions
  - math
