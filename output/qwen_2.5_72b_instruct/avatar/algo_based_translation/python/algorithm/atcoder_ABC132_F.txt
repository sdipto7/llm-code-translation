Function signature: `main()`
Variable declarations:
- `mod` as integer initialized to \(10^9 + 7\)
- `n`, `k` as integers read from input
- `coef` as list of integers
- `i` as integer used in loop
- `tmp` as integer used in inner loop
- `j` as integer used in inner loop
- `nn` as integer representing length of `coef`
- `dp` as 2D list of integers initialized with zeros
- `sum(dp[k])` as integer representing final result

Execution order and logic flow:
1. Read integers `n` and `k` from input
2. Initialize empty list `coef`
3. Loop with `i` from 1 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) inclusive:
   - Append \((n // i) - (n // (i + 1))\) to `coef`
4. Append 1 to `coef` until length of `coef` equals `n`
5. Reverse `coef`
6. Assign length of `coef` to `nn`
7. Initialize 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(k+1) x nn` filled with zeros
8. Set `dp[0][0]` to 1
9. Loop with `i` from 1 to `k` inclusive:
   - Set `tmp` to 0
   - Loop with `j` from `nn-1` to 0 inclusive:
     - Add `dp[i-1][(nn-1)-j]` to `tmp`
     - Take modulo `mod` of `tmp`
     - Set `dp[i][j]` to `coef[j] * tmp`
     - Take modulo `mod` of `dp[i][j]`
10. Print the sum of elements in `dp[k]` modulo `mod`

Control structures:
- For loops with specified ranges
- No conditional statements

Input/output operations:
- Input: Reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input
- Output: Prints single integer, sum of elements in `dp[k]` modulo `mod`, to standard output

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No specific imports required
