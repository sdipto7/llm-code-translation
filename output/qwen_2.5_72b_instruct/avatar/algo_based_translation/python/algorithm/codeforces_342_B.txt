Function Signatures:
- `R(): List[int]`

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `R: lambda function`
- `n: int`
- `m: int`
- `s: int`
- `f: int`
- `d: int`
- `c: str`
- `res: str`
- `i: int`
- `j: int`
- `t: int`
- `l: int`
- `r: int`
- `k: int`

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. `R()` is called to read three integers `n`, `m`, `s`, `f` from input.
2. If `s < f`:
   - `d` is set to 1
   - `c` is set to 'R'
3. Else:
   - `d` is set to -1
   - `c` is set to 'L'
4. `res` is initialized as an empty string
5. `i` is initialized to 1
6. `j` is initialized to `s`
7. `R()` is called to read three integers `t`, `l`, `r` from input
8. `k` is initialized to 1

Control Structures:
- While loop: `while j != f`
  - If condition: `if i > t and k < m`
    - `R()` is called to read new values for `t`, `l`, `r`
    - `k` is incremented by 1
  - If condition: `if i == t and (l <= j <= r or l <= j + d <= r)`
    - `res` is concatenated with 'X'
  - Else:
    - `res` is concatenated with `c`
    - `j` is incremented by `d`
  - `i` is incremented by 1

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input: The program reads multiple lines of space-separated integers from standard input.
- Output: The program prints a string `res` to standard output.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules are required.
