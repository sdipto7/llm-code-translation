Algorithm:
Function signature: main() -> None

Variable declarations:
- n: int
- m: int
- x: int
- c: np.ndarray with shape (n, m+1) containing integers
- pre: np.ndarray with shape (n) containing integers from 0 to n-1
- l: List of lists of integers
- rem: List of integers
- ans: int

Logic flow:
1. Read integers n, m, x from input
2. Initialize c as a 2D numpy array of size (n, m+1) with integers from input
3. Initialize pre as a numpy array containing integers from 0 to n-1
4. Initialize empty list l
5. Initialize empty list rem
6. Initialize ans as 0
7. For i in range from 1 to n+1:
    a. For combination j in combinations of pre of length i:
        i. Append list of j to l
8. For i in range from 1 to m+1:
    a. For index j and combination k in enumerated l:
        i. Initialize ca as 0
        ii. For each element ii in k:
            1. Add c[ii][i] to ca
        iii. If ca is less than x:
            1. Insert j at the beginning of rem
        iv. Else:
            1. Pass
    b. If rem is not empty:
        i. For each element j in rem:
            1. Remove element at index j from l
        ii. Reset rem to an empty list
    c. If l is empty:
        i. Print -1
        ii. Break
9. Else:
    a. For each combination i in l:
        i. Initialize ca as 0
        ii. For each element j in i:
            1. Add c[j][0] to ca
        iii. If ans is 0:
            1. Set ans to ca
        iv. Else:
            1. Set ans to the minimum of ans and ca
    b. Print ans

Input/Output operations:
- Read n, m, x from input
- Read c from input
- Print either -1 or the minimum possible value of ans

Data processing logic:
- Generate all possible combinations of indices from 0 to n-1
- For each combination, check if the sum of the i-th skill levels is at least x
- Remove combinations that do not meet the requirement for each skill level
- Find the combination with the minimum cost if any combinations remain

Required libraries:
- numpy
- itertools
