Function signature: `calculate_operations(t: int, s: int, q: int) -> int`

Variable declarations and data types:
- t: int
- s: int
- q: int
- ans: int

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read three integers from standard input and assign them to variables t, s, q respectively.
2. Initialize ans to 0.
3. Enter while loop with condition (s < t).
4. Inside loop:
   - Multiply s by q.
   - Increment ans by 1.
5. Continue loop until condition (s < t) is false.
6. Print the value of ans.

Control structures:
- While loop with condition (s < t).

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Three space-separated integers t, s, q.
- Process: Repeatedly multiply s by q and increment ans until s is no longer less than t.
- Output: Print the number of operations (ans).

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required.
