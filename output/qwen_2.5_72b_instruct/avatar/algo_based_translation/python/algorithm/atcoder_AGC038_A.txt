Function Signature: `solve(H: int, W: int, A: int, B: int)`
Variable Declarations: 
- `answer`: List[List[str]] initialized as a 2D list of size HxW filled with "0"

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize `answer` as a 2D list of size HxW filled with "0"
2. For each row index `i` from 0 to H-1:
   - For each column index `j` from 0 to W-1:
     - If `i` is less than B:
       - If `j` is less than A:
         - Set `answer[i][j]` to "0"
       - Else:
         - Set `answer[i][j]` to "1"
     - Else:
       - If `j` is less than A:
         - Set `answer[i][j]` to "1"
       - Else:
         - Set `answer[i][j]` to "0"
3. For each row index `i` from 0 to H-1:
   - Print the joined string of `answer[i]`

Function Signature: `main()`
Variable Declarations:
- `tokens`: Generator object from `iterate_tokens()`
- `H`: int, next token converted to integer
- `W`: int, next token converted to integer
- `A`: int, next token converted to integer
- `B`: int, next token converted to integer

Logic Flow:
1. Define nested function `iterate_tokens()`:
   - For each line in standard input:
     - For each word in line split by spaces:
       - Yield word
2. Create generator object `tokens` from `iterate_tokens()`
3. Assign `H` as next value from `tokens` converted to integer
4. Assign `W` as next value from `tokens` converted to integer
5. Assign `A` as next value from `tokens` converted to integer
6. Assign `B` as next value from `tokens` converted to integer
7. Call `solve(H, W, A, B)`
