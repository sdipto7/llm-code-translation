Function: main
Parameters: String[] args
Return Type: void

Libraries: java.util.LinkedList, java.util.Scanner

Variable Declarations:
- Scanner scan
- LinkedList<Integer> list
- int a

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize Scanner object to read input from standard input.
2. Initialize LinkedList of Integers to store integer values.
3. Enter a while loop that continues as long as there is an integer to read from input.
4. Inside loop:
   a. Read next integer from input and store it in variable a.
   b. Check if a is equal to 0:
      - If true, pop the first element from the LinkedList and print it.
      - If false, push a onto the LinkedList.
5. Exit loop when there are no more integers to read from input.
