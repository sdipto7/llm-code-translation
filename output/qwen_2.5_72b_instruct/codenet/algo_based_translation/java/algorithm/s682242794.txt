Function Signature:
- solve() with no parameters and no return type

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- int high
- int low
- int sa

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. Create an instance of the Scanner class
2. Start a for loop that iterates 7 times
3. Inside the loop, read an integer from the scanner and assign it to high
4. Read another integer from the scanner and assign it to low
5. Calculate the difference between high and low, assign it to sa
6. Print the value of sa
7. End the loop
8. Close the scanner (not explicitly shown in the code but good practice)

Control Structures:
- for loop with the condition i < 7

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input: Reads two integers per iteration from the standard input
- Output: Prints the difference between the two integers (sa) after each iteration

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- java.util.Scanner
