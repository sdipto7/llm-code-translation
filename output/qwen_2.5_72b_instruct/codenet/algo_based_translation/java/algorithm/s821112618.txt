Function Signature: `main(String[] args): void`
Variable Declarations: 
- `sc: Scanner`
- `n: int`
- `s: String[]`
- `k: char[][]`
- `i: int`
- `c: char[]`
- `l: int`
- `a: int`

Execution Flow:
1. Initialize `Scanner` object `sc` to read input.
2. Read integer `n` from input, representing the number of test cases.
3. Split the string `",.!?:abc:def:ghi:jkl:mno:pqrs:tuv:wxyz"` by `":"` and store in array `s`.
4. Initialize 2D character array `k` with 9 rows.
5. For each index `i` from 0 to 8, convert string `s[i]` to character array and store in `k[i]`.
6. While `n` is greater than 0:
   1. Read next input string and convert to character array `c`.
   2. Initialize `l` to -1 and `a` to 0.
   3. For each index `i` from 0 to length of `c` - 1:
      1. If `c[i]` is not '0':
         1. Set `a` to `c[i] - '1'`.
         2. Increment `l` by 1 and take modulo with length of `k[a]`.
      2. Else if `l` is greater than or equal to 0:
         1. Print character `k[a][l]`.
         2. Set `l` to -1.
   4. Print a newline character.
