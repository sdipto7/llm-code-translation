Function Signature: main(String[] args) - Return Type: void

Variable Declarations:
- Scanner sc - Data Type: Scanner
- int[] numlist - Data Type: int array with size 5
- int k - Data Type: int

Logic Flow:
1. Create a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream.
2. Declare an integer array numlist of size 5.
3. Declare an integer variable k.
4. Loop from 0 to 4 (inclusive):
   - Read an integer from the scanner and store it in numlist[i].
5. Read an integer from the scanner and store it in k.
6. If the difference between the 5th element and the 1st element of numlist is greater than k:
   - Print ":(".
7. Otherwise:
   - Print "Yay!".

Control Structures:
- For loop: Iterates from 0 to 4, inclusive.
- If-else statement: Checks if (numlist[4] - numlist[0]) > k.

Input/Output:
- Input: 6 integers from the user (first 5 are stored in numlist, the 6th is stored in k).
- Output: Either ":(" or "Yay!" based on the condition.

Libraries/Modules:
- java.util.Scanner
