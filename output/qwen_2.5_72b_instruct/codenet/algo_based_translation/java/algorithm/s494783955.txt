Function signatures:
- main(String[] args): void

Variable declarations and data types:
- sc: Scanner
- C: String

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Create a new Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream and assign it to sc.
2. Read the next token from the input as a String and assign it to C.
3. Convert the first character of C to its ASCII value, add 1 to it, convert the result back to a character, and print it to the standard output.

Control structures:
- No explicit loops or conditionals.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads a single string token from the user.
- Processing: Converts the first character of the string to its next ASCII character.
- Output: Prints the resulting character to the console.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- java.util.Scanner
