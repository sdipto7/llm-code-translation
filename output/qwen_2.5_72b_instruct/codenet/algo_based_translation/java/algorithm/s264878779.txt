Function Signature:
- main(String[] args): void

Variable Declarations:
- sc: Scanner
- s: String
- n: int
- ans: long
- mask: int
- sum: long
- x: String
- split: String[]
- i: int

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize Scanner sc to read input.
2. Read a string s from input.
3. Set n to the length of s.
4. Initialize ans to 0.
5. For mask from 0 to 2^(n-1) - 1:
   a. Initialize sum to 0.
   b. Set x to the first character of s.
   c. For i from 0 to n-2:
      i. If (mask & (1 << i)) is greater than or equal to 1:
         1. Append "+" and the (i+1)th character of s to x.
      ii. Else:
          1. Append the (i+1)th character of s to x.
   d. Split x by "+" into split array.
   e. For i from 0 to length of split - 1:
      i. Convert split[i] to long and add to sum.
   f. Add sum to ans.
6. Print ans.
