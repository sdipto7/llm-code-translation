Function signature: main(String[] args)

Variable declarations and data types:  
Scanner sc  
int a  
int b  
int c  
int count  

Logic flow in execution order:  
1. Create a Scanner object to read input from standard input
2. Read the first integer input and store it in variable a  
3. Read the second integer input and store it in variable b  
4. Read the third integer input and store it in variable c  
5. Initialize count to 0  
6. For each integer i from a to b inclusive:
    - If c modulo i equals 0:
        - Increment count by 1  
7. Print the value of count

Control structures:  
For loop with condition i <= b  
If statement with condition c % i == 0

Input operations:  
Read three integers from standard input

Output operations:  
Print the value of count to standard output

Libraries/modules/dependencies:  
java.util.Scanner
