Function signatures with parameter and return types:
main(String[] args): void

Variable declarations and data types:
Scanner scanner: Scanner
int h: int
int a: int

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Create a new Scanner object for standard input and assign it to the variable scanner
2. Read the next integer from the scanner and assign it to the variable h
3. Read the next integer from the scanner and assign it to the variable a
4. Check if h modulo a equals 0
   - If true, print the result of h divided by a
   - If false, print the result of h divided by a plus 1

Control structures:
if (h % a == 0)

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read integers h and a from standard input
- Processing: Calculate h / a, check if there is a remainder, adjust result if necessary
- Output: Print the calculated number of days

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
Scanner (from java.util package)
