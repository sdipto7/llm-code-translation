Function Signature: `main(String[] args)`

Variable Declarations:
- `sc` of type `Scanner`
- `a` of type `int`
- `b` of type `int`
- `c` of type `int`
- `answer` of type `String`

Logic Flow:
1. Create an instance of `Scanner` and assign it to `sc`
2. Read an integer from the standard input and assign it to `a`
3. Read an integer from the standard input and assign it to `b`
4. Read an integer from the standard input and assign it to `c`
5. Assign the string "No" to `answer`
6. If the sum of `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`:
   - Assign the string "Yes" to `answer`
7. Print the value of `answer` to the standard output

Control Structures:
- Conditional (if): `if(a + b >= c)`

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Three integers read from the standard input
- Output: A single string ("Yes" or "No") printed to the standard output

Libraries:
- `java.util.Scanner`
