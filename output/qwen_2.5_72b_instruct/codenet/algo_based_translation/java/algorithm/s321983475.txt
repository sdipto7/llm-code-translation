Function signatures with parameter and return types:
- main(String[] args): void

Variable declarations and data types:
- sc: Scanner
- w: int
- a: int
- b: int
- answer: int

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Create a Scanner object named sc to read input.
2. Read an integer from standard input and assign it to w.
3. Read an integer from standard input and assign it to a.
4. Read an integer from standard input and assign it to b.
5. Calculate the absolute difference between a and b by subtracting the minimum of a and b from the maximum of a and b, then subtract w from this result. Assign the result to answer.
6. If answer is less than 0, print 0.
7. Otherwise, print the value of answer.

Control structures (loops, conditionals) with exact conditions:
- If condition: answer < 0

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Three integers from standard input.
- Output: A single integer printed to standard output, either 0 or the calculated value of answer.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- java.util.*
