Function signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)`
- `int N = scanner.nextInt()`
- `List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList()`
- `int count = 0`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the standard input stream.
2. Read an integer `N` from the input, representing the number of integers to be processed.
3. Initialize an empty `ArrayList` of `Integer` type to store the numbers.
4. Loop from 0 to `N-1` to read `N` integers from the input and add them to the `numbers` list.
5. Initialize a counter `count` to 0.
6. Begin a `do-while` loop that continues as long as the size of the `numbers` list remains equal to `N`.
7. Inside the loop, perform the following operations on the `numbers` list:
   - Filter out odd numbers by keeping only those numbers that are divisible by 2.
   - Divide each remaining number by 2.
   - Collect the results back into a new `ArrayList`.
8. If the size of the updated `numbers` list is still equal to `N`, increment the `count` by 1.
9. After exiting the loop, print the value of `count`.

Control structures:
- `for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)`: Loop to read `N` integers.
- `do { ... } while(numbers.size() == N)`: Loop to repeatedly process the list until its size changes.
- `if (numbers.size() == N)`: Condition to check if the size of the list remains unchanged.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads `N` integers from the standard input.
- Output: Prints the count of iterations where the size of the list did not change after processing.
- Data processing: Filters and divides the numbers in the list, checks the size of the list, and counts iterations.
