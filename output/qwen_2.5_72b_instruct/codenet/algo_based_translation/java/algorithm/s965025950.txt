- Function Signatures:
  - main(String[] args) : void

- Variable Declarations and Data Types:
  - sc : Scanner
  - x : int
  - y : int
  - z : int

- Logic Flow in Execution Order:
  1. Create a new Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream.
  2. Read the next integer from the scanner and assign it to x.
  3. Read the next integer from the scanner and assign it to y.
  4. Read the next integer from the scanner and assign it to z.
  5. Print z, x, and y in that order, separated by spaces.
  6. Close the scanner to free up system resources.

- Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
  - Input: Three integers from the standard input.
  - Output: The three integers in the order z, x, y, separated by spaces.

- Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
  - java.util.Scanner
