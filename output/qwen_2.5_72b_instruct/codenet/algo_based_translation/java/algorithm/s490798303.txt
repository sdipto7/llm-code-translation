Function signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)`
- `int n = scanner.nextInt()`
- `int k = scanner.nextInt()`
- `Map<Integer, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>()`
- `int d = scanner.nextInt()`
- `int person = scanner.nextInt()`
- `int count = 0`

Logic flow in execution order:
- Create a `Scanner` object to read input
- Read `n` (number of people)
- Read `k` (number of groups)
- Initialize a `HashMap` to store each person and their associated group sizes
- Loop `k` times to process each group:
  - Read `d` (number of people in the current group)
  - Loop `d` times to process each person in the current group:
    - Read `person` (current person's identifier)
    - If `person` is not in the map, add them with an empty list
    - Add `d` to the list of group sizes for `person`
- Initialize `count` to 0 to track people not in any group
- Loop from 1 to `n` to check each person:
  - If the person is not in the map, increment `count`
- Print `count` (number of people not in any group)

Control structures:
- `for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)` loop to iterate over each group
- `for (int j = 0; j < d; j++)` nested loop to iterate over each person in the current group
- `if (!map.containsKey(person))` conditional to check if a person is already in the map
- `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)` loop to iterate over each person to count those not in any group
- `if (!map.containsKey(i))` conditional to check if a person is not in any group

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Read integers from standard input using `scanner.nextInt()` for `n`, `k`, `d`, and `person`
- Store group sizes for each person in a `HashMap`
- Count people not present in the map
- Output the count of people not in any group using `System.out.println(count)`

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `java.util.*` for `Scanner`, `Map`, `List`, and `ArrayList`
