Function signatures:
- `public static void main(String[] args)`: Takes an array of strings as input, no return value.

Variable declarations and data types:
- `Scanner sc`: For reading input.
- `int n`: Number of elements.
- `int[] h`: Array to store the input integers.
- `int max`: To keep track of the maximum count of consecutive non-increasing elements.
- `int count`: To count consecutive non-increasing elements.
- `int l`: Loop variable.

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Create a `Scanner` object to read input.
2. Read an integer `n` from the input.
3. Initialize an array `h` of size `n`.
4. Loop from `0` to `n-1` to fill the array `h` with integers read from the input.
5. Initialize `max` to `0`.
6. Loop from `0` to `n-2` using variable `l`:
   - Initialize `count` to `0`.
   - While `l` is less than `n-1` and `h[l]` is greater than or equal to `h[l+1]`:
     - Increment `l`.
     - Increment `count`.
   - Update `max` to the maximum of `max` and `count`.
7. Print the value of `max`.

Control structures:
- For loop for reading the array elements.
- For loop with a while loop nested inside for counting consecutive non-increasing elements.
- While loop condition is `l < n - 1 && h[l] >= h[l + 1]`.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Read an integer `n` and `n` integers to fill the array `h`.
- Process the array to find the maximum count of consecutive non-increasing elements.
- Output the maximum count.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `java.util.Scanner`
