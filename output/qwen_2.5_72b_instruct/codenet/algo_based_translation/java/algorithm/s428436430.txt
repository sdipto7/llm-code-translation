Algorithm:

Function Signatures:
- int Area(int w, int h)

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- int area
- int w
- int h
- Scanner sc
- List<Integer> arr

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. Create a new instance of Scanner named sc
2. Create a new ArrayList of Integer named arr
3. Loop 4 times:
   - Read next integer input using sc.next(), parse it to an integer, and add it to arr
4. Create a new instance of calArea named ab
5. Call ab.Area with arr.get(0) and arr.get(1) as arguments, store result in area1
6. Call ab.Area with arr.get(2) and arr.get(3) as arguments, store result in area2
7. If area1 > area2, print area1
8. Else if area1 < area2, print area2
9. Else if area1 == area2, print area1

Control Structures:
- For loop: i from 0 to 3
- If-else-if structure: checks conditions area1 > area2, area1 < area2, area1 == area2

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input: Four integers read from standard input
- Output: One integer printed to standard output, which is the larger of the two areas calculated or either if they are equal

Required Libraries:
- java.util.*
