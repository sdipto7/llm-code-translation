Function Signature:
- `main(String[] args)`: void

Variable Declarations:
- `br`: BufferedReader
- `pw`: PrintWriter
- `s`: StringTokenizer
- `n`: int
- `hm`: HashMap<Integer, Integer>
- `val`: int
- `ans`: int
- `num`: int

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize `br` to read input from standard input.
2. Initialize `pw` to write output to standard output.
3. Read a line of input and tokenize it into `s`.
4. Parse the first token from `s` as an integer and assign it to `n`.
5. Initialize an empty `HashMap` `hm` to store integer keys and their counts.
6. Read another line of input and tokenize it into `s`.
7. For `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
   - Parse the `i`-th token from `s` as an integer and assign it to `val`.
   - Update `hm` by incrementing the count of `val` by 1.
8. Initialize `ans` to 0.
9. For each `val` in the key set of `hm`:
   - Retrieve the count of `val` from `hm` and assign it to `num`.
   - If `num` is greater than `val`, add `num - val` to `ans`.
   - Else if `num` is less than `val`, add `num` to `ans`.
10. Write `ans` to standard output.
11. Close `pw`.
