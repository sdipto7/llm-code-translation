Function signatures:
- main(String[] args): void

Variable declarations and data types:
- BufferedReader br: BufferedReader
- int n: int
- String str[]: String[]
- int s[]: int[100010]
- int dec: int
- int one: int
- int two: int
- int i: int (loop index)

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Create BufferedReader object br for reading input from System.in
2. Read integer n from input
3. Read a line of space-separated strings and split into array str
4. Initialize array s of size 100010 with all elements set to 0
5. For each element in str:
   - Convert string to integer and use as index to increment corresponding element in s by 1
6. Set dec to 0
7. For each element in s:
   - If element is not 0:
     - If element is even, set element to 2
     - Otherwise, set element to 1
8. Set one to 0
9. Set two to 0
10. For each element in s:
    - If element is 2, increment two by 1
    - Else if element is 1, increment one by 1
11. If two is odd, decrement one by 1
12. Print the sum of two and one

Control structures:
- Loop for reading and processing input numbers
- Conditional for checking if element in s is not 0
- Nested conditional for setting element in s to 2 or 1 based on evenness
- Loop for counting occurrences of 1 and 2 in s
- Conditional for adjusting one if two is odd

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Read integer n from input
- Read space-separated string of numbers, split into array str
- Convert each string in str to integer and count occurrences using array s
- Process array s to replace counts with 1 or 2 based on evenness
- Count occurrences of 1 and 2 in processed array s
- Adjust count of ones if necessary
- Output final count of twos plus adjusted count of ones

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- java.io.BufferedReader
- java.io.IOException
- java.io.InputStreamReader
