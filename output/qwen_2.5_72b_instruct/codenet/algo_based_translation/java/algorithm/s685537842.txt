Function signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`

Variable declarations:
- `Scanner sc` of type `Scanner`
- `int a`
- `int b`
- `int t`
- `double time` initialized to `0`
- `int count` initialized to `0`

Logic flow:
1. Create a `Scanner` object to read input from standard input.
2. Read the first integer input and assign it to `a`.
3. Read the second integer input and assign it to `b`.
4. Read the third integer input and assign it to `t`.
5. Enter a `while` loop that continues as long as `time` is less than `t + 0.5`.
6. Inside the loop, increment `count` by `b`.
7. Increment `time` by `a`.
8. Check if `time` is greater than `t + 0.5`.
   - If true, decrement `count` by `b` and exit the loop using `break`.
9. After the loop, print the value of `count`.

Input/output operations:
- Use `sc.nextInt()` to read three integer inputs.
- Use `System.out.println(count)` to print the final count.
