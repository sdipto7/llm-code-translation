Function: main
Parameters: String[] args (array of strings)
Return Type: void

Variable Declarations:
Scanner stdIn (Scanner object)
int N (integer)
int X (integer)
int[] m (array of integers with size N)
int min (integer)

Logic Flow:

1. Create a Scanner object named stdIn to read standard input.
2. Read an integer value from stdIn and assign it to N.
3. Read another integer value from stdIn and assign it to X.
4. Initialize an array m of integers with size N.
5. Read the first integer value from stdIn and assign it to m[0].
6. Subtract m[0] from X.
7. Assign m[0] to min.
8. For loop starts with i = 1 and continues while i is less than N:
   8.1 Read an integer value from stdIn and assign it to m[i].
   8.2 Subtract m[i] from X.
   8.3 If m[i] is less than min, then assign m[i] to min.
9. End of for loop.
10. Print the result of N + X / min.
