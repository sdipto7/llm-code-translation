Function: main
Parameters: String[] args
Return Type: void

Variables:
- sc (Scanner)
- i (int)

Libraries:
- java.util.Scanner
- java.io

Execution Flow:
1. Initialize a Scanner object sc to read input from standard input.
2. Begin a for loop with i initialized to 0, loop while i is less than 5, increment i by 1 after each iteration.
3. Inside the loop, read the next integer from the scanner.
4. Check if the read integer is equal to 0.
5. If true, print the value of i plus 1.
6. Break out of the loop.
7. If false, continue to the next iteration of the loop.
