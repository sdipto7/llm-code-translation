- Function signature: public static void main(String[] args)
- Variable declarations: 
  - Scanner sc (type: Scanner)
  - String s (type: String)
  - int total (type: int, initial value: 0)
- Logic flow in execution order:
  - Create a Scanner object to read input
  - Read a string from standard input and store it in variable s
  - Initialize total to 0
  - Start outer for loop with i from 0 to s.length() - 1
    - Start inner for loop with j from i + 1 to s.length() - 1
      - Check if character at index i in s is equal to character at index j in s
        - If true, increment total by 1
    - End inner for loop
  - End outer for loop
  - Check if total is equal to 2
    - If true, print "Yes"
    - Otherwise, print "No"
- Control structures:
  - Outer for loop with condition i < s.length()
  - Inner for loop with condition j < s.length()
  - If statement with condition s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)
  - Ternary operator with condition total == 2
- Input/output operations:
  - Read input using sc.next() and store in s
  - Print "Yes" or "No" based on the value of total
- Required libraries/modules/dependencies:
  - import java.util.Scanner
