Function signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `Scanner sc` of type `Scanner`
- `int a` of type `int`
- `int b` of type `int`
- `boolean[] ju` of type `boolean[]`
- `int[] pe` of type `int[]`
- `int wa` of type `int`
- `int ac` of type `int`
- `int n` of type `int`
- `String res` of type `String`
- `int i` of type `int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Create a `Scanner` object to read input.
2. Read two integers `a` and `b` from input.
3. Initialize a boolean array `ju` of size 100001 with all values set to `false`.
4. Initialize an integer array `pe` of size 100001 with all values set to 0.
5. Initialize `wa` to 0.
6. Initialize `ac` to 0.
7. For `i` from 0 to `b-1`:
   1. Read an integer `n` from input.
   2. Read a string `res` from input.
   3. If `res` is equal to "WA" and `ju[n-1]` is `false`:
      1. Increment `pe[n-1]` by 1.
   4. If `res` is equal to "AC":
      1. Set `ju[n-1]` to `true`.
8. For `i` from 0 to `a-1`:
   1. If `ju[i]` is `true`:
      1. Increment `ac` by 1.
      2. Add `pe[i]` to `wa`.
9. Print `ac` followed by a space and then `wa`.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Reads two integers from the standard input.
- Reads `b` pairs of an integer and a string from the standard input.
- Processes the results to count the number of accepted solutions (`ac`) and the number of wrong answers (`wa`) that occurred before an accepted solution for each problem.
- Outputs the total number of accepted solutions and the total number of wrong answers that occurred before any accepted solution.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `java.util.Scanner`
