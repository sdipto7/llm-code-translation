Function Signatures:
- `main(String[] args): void`
- `read(): boolean`
- `slove(): void`

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `sc: Scanner`
- `score: int[]`
- `number: int`
- `sum: int`

Execution Order and Logic Flow:
1. Initialize `Scanner` object `sc`.
2. Enter while loop that continues as long as `read()` returns true.
3. Inside while loop, call `slove()`.

Control Structures:
- While loop: Continues as long as `read()` returns true.
- If statement in `read()`: Checks if `number` is 0, returns false if true.
- For loop in `read()`: Iterates from 0 to `number-1`, assigns input values to `score[i]`.
- For loop in `slove()`: Iterates from 1 to `number-2`, sums up `score[i]`.

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input: Reads integer value for `number`. If `number` is 0, terminates program. Otherwise, reads `number` integers into `score` array.
- Processing: Sorts `score` array. Calculates sum of elements from index 1 to `number-2`. Computes average of these elements.
- Output: Prints the computed average.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- `java.util.*`
