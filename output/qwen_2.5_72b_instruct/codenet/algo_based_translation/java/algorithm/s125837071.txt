Function signatures:
- main(String[] args): void
- findS(int k, int i): int

Variable declarations and data types:
- Scanner scanner: for input
- int n: input number
- long ans: to store the final result, initialized to 1
- int mod: modulus value, set to \(10^9 + 7\)
- int i, j, k: loop indices
- int s: to accumulate sum of powers of prime factors

Logic flow in execution order:
- Create a Scanner object to read input
- Read integer n from input
- Initialize ans to 1 and mod to \(10^9 + 7\)
- Loop over i from 2 to n
  - Loop over j from 2 to i
    - If j equals i or i is divisible by j
      - If j equals i
        - Initialize s to 0
        - Loop over k from 1 to n
          - Add result of findS(k, i) to s
        - Update ans to \((ans * (s + 1)) \mod mod\)
- Print ans

Control structures:
- for loop for i from 2 to n
- for loop for j from 2 to i with condition \((i \% j \neq 0 \land j < i) \lor j == i\)
- if statement with condition \(j == i\)
- for loop for k from 1 to n
- if statement within findS with condition \(j \% i == 0\)

Input/output operations:
- Read integer n from standard input
- Print long ans to standard output

Data processing logic:
- Determine if a number i is prime by checking divisibility from 2 to i
- For each prime i, calculate the sum s of powers of i in numbers from 1 to n
- Update ans by multiplying it with \((s + 1)\) and taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\)

Required libraries:
- java.util.Scanner

Function findS logic:
- Initialize s to 0
- While k is divisible by i, divide k by i and increment s
- Return s
