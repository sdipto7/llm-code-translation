Function signatures with parameter and return types:
- `static boolean read()`: Returns a boolean value.
- `static int solve()`: Returns an integer value.
- `public static void main(String[] args)`: No return value.

Variable declarations and data types:
- `static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);`: Scanner object for reading input.
- `static int d;`: Integer variable to store input value.
- `int ans;`: Integer variable to store the final result.
- `int n;`: Integer variable (unused in the provided code).
- `int x;`: Integer variable to store the current multiple of `d`.
- `int y;`: Integer variable to store the square of `x`.

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. The `main` method starts executing.
2. The `while` loop checks if there is another integer to read using the `read` method.
3. The `read` method checks if there is a next integer available in the input.
   - If no integer is available, it returns `false`, and the `while` loop terminates.
   - If an integer is available, it reads the integer into `d` and returns `true`.
4. If `read` returns `true`, the `solve` method is called.
5. Inside `solve`, `ans` is initialized to 0.
6. A `for` loop iterates with `int i = 1` and continues as long as `i * d < 600`.
   - In each iteration, `x` is calculated as `i * d`.
   - `y` is calculated as `x * x`.
   - `ans` is incremented by `y * d`.
7. After the loop completes, `solve` returns the value of `ans`.
8. The returned value from `solve` is printed to the standard output.
9. The `while` loop repeats until there are no more integers to read.

Control structures:
- `while` loop: Continues as long as `read()` returns `true`.
- `for` loop: Iterates from `i = 1` to `i * d < 600`.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads integers from standard input using `Scanner`.
- Output: Prints the result of `solve` to standard output using `System.out.println`.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `java.util.*`: For using the `Scanner` class.
