Function Signature: main(String[] args) -> void

Variable Declarations:
- sc: Scanner
- s: String
- s1: String
- s2: String
- s3: String
- s4: String
- a: int

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize sc as new Scanner object for standard input
2. Read next string input from sc and assign to s
3. Extract substring from s from index 0 to 1 and assign to s1
4. Extract substring from s from index 1 to 2 and assign to s2
5. Extract substring from s from index 2 to 3 and assign to s3
6. Extract substring from s from index 3 to 4 and assign to s4
7. Initialize a to 0
8. If s1 equals s2 then set a to 1
9. If s2 equals s3 then set a to 1
10. If s3 equals s4 then set a to 1
11. If a equals 1 then print "Bad"
12. Else print "Good"

Control Structures:
- Conditional: If s1 equals s2 then set a to 1
- Conditional: If s2 equals s3 then set a to 1
- Conditional: If s3 equals s4 then set a to 1
- Conditional: If a equals 1 then print "Bad" else print "Good"

Input/Output Operations:
- Read string input from standard input
- Print "Bad" or "Good" based on condition

Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- java.util.Scanner
