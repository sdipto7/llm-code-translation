Function signatures with parameter and return types:
- main(String[] args) : void

Variable declarations and data types:
- HashMap<String, String> map
- Scanner sc
- int n
- String str
- int i

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Create a new instance of HashMap<String, String> and assign it to map.
2. Create a new instance of Scanner for standard input and assign it to sc.
3. Read an integer value from the input and assign it to n.
4. Read a line of string input and discard it.
5. For loop starts with initialization i = 0, continues while i < n, and increments i by 1 after each iteration:
   5.1 Read a line of string input and use it as the key to put an empty string value in the map.
6. Close the Scanner instance sc.
7. Print the size of the map.

Control structures:
- For loop with condition i < n

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: An integer n followed by n lines of strings.
- Output: The size of the map.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- java.util.HashMap
- java.util.Scanner
