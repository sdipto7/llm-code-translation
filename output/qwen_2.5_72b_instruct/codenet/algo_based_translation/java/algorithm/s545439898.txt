Function signatures with parameter and return types:
- main(String[] args): void

Variable declarations and data types:
- Scanner sc: Scanner
- int count: int
- int[] givingNumbers: int array

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Create a Scanner object named sc for reading input.
2. Read an integer value from input and store it in variable count.
3. Declare an integer array givingNumbers of size count.
4. For loop from i = 0 to count - 1:
   - Read an integer value from input and store it in givingNumbers[i].
5. For loop from i = count - 1 to 0:
   - Print the value of givingNumbers[i].
   - If i > 0, print a space character.
6. Print a newline character.
7. Close the Scanner object sc.

Control structures with exact conditions:
- For loop: i < count
- For loop: 0 <= i
- If statement: i > 0

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: An integer count followed by count number of integers.
- Process: Store the integers in an array and then reverse the order of the integers in the array.
- Output: Print the reversed integers separated by spaces.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- java.util.Scanner
