Function Signature:  
main(String[] args): void  

Variable Declarations and Data Types:  
Scanner scan: Scanner  
int size: int  
int[][] graph: int[][]  
int id: int  
int cols: int  
int[] row: int[]  

Logic Flow in Execution Order:  
- Create a new Scanner object to read input from System.in  
- Read an integer input for size  
- Initialize a 2D integer array graph with dimensions size x size  
- Initialize id to 0  
- Initialize cols to 0  
- Initialize row as an empty integer array  

Outer Loop (i from 0 to size - 1):  
- Read an integer input for id  
- Read an integer input for cols  
- Reinitialize row as an integer array with length size  
Inner Loop (j from 0 to cols - 1):  
- Read an integer input, subtract 1, and set the corresponding index in row to 1  
- Set the row at index id - 1 in graph to the current row array  

Outer Loop (i from 0 to length of graph - 1):  
Inner Loop (j from 0 to length of graph[i] - 1):  
- Print the value at graph[i][j]  
- If j is less than length of graph[i] - 1, print a space  
- After inner loop, print a newline character
