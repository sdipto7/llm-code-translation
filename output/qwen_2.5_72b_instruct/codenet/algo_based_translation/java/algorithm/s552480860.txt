Function signature: `public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `Scanner sc` of type `Scanner`
- `int h1` of type `int`
- `int m1` of type `int`
- `int h2` of type `int`
- `int m2` of type `int`
- `int k` of type `int`
- `int t1` of type `int`
- `int t2` of type `int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Initialize `Scanner` object `sc`
2. Read `h1` from input
3. Read `m1` from input
4. Read `h2` from input
5. Read `m2` from input
6. Read `k` from input
7. Calculate `t1` as `h1 * 60 + m1`
8. Calculate `t2` as `h2 * 60 + m2`
9. Print `t2 - t1 - k`

Control structures: No loops or conditionals present

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read five integers from standard input representing hours and minutes of two times and a duration in minutes
- Output: Print the difference in minutes between the two times minus the duration `k`

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `java.util.Scanner`
