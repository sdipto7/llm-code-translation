Main

function signatures with parameter and return types:
- main(String[] args): void

variable declarations and data types:
- Scanner scan: Scanner
- int n: integer
- int count: integer
- int i: integer

complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Create a Scanner object to read input from standard input.
2. Read an integer value from the scanner and assign it to variable n.
3. Initialize an integer variable count to 0.
4. Start a for loop with variable i initialized to 1 and continue while i is less than or equal to n.
5. Inside the loop, add the value of i to count.
6. Increment the value of i by 1.
7. After the loop ends, print the value of count to standard output.

control structures:
- for loop with condition i <= n

input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read an integer from standard input.
- Processing: Sum all integers from 1 to n.
- Output: Print the resulting sum to standard output.

required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- java.util.Scanner
