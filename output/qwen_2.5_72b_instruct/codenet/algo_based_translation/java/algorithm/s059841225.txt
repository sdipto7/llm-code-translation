Function signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`

Variable declarations:
- `Scanner sc` of type `Scanner`
- `String str` of type `String`
- `String[] strArr` of type `String[]`
- `int[] l` of type `int[]` with size 10
- `int d` of type `int`
- `int i` of type `int` (loop index)
- `int[] v` of type `int[]` with size 2
- `double t` of type `double`

Logic flow:
- Initialize `sc` as a new `Scanner` object reading from standard input.
- Enter a `while` loop that continues as long as there are more tokens available in the input.
- Read the next token as a `String` and assign it to `str`.
- Split `str` by commas and store the result in `strArr`.
- Initialize `l` as an integer array of size 10.
- Initialize `d` to 0.
- Iterate over `i` from 0 to 9:
  - Parse `strArr[i]` as an integer and assign it to `l[i]`.
  - Add `l[i]` to `d`.
- Initialize `v` as an integer array of size 2.
- Parse `strArr[10]` as an integer and assign it to `v[0]`.
- Parse `strArr[11]` as an integer and assign it to `v[1]`.
- Calculate `t` as the division of `d` by the sum of `v[0]` and `v[1]`, cast to `double`.
- Reset `d` to 0.
- Iterate over `i` from 0 to 10:
  - If `v[0] * t` is less than or equal to `d`, print `i` and break the loop.
  - Otherwise, add `l[i]` to `d`.

Libraries/modules/dependencies:
- Import `java.util.*` for using `Scanner`.
