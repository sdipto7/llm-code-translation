Function signature: main(String[] args) - void

Variable declarations:
- Scanner sc - for input
- int a - first operand
- String op - operator
- int b - second operand

Logic flow:
1. Initialize Scanner object sc for reading input.
2. Enter an infinite loop:
    a. Read integer a from input.
    b. Read string op from input.
    c. Read integer b from input.
    d. If op is "?", break out of the loop.
    e. If op is "+", print the sum of a and b.
    f. If op is "-", print the difference of a and b.
    g. If op is "*", print the product of a and b.
    h. If op is "/", print the quotient of a and b.

Control structures:
- while(true) - infinite loop until break condition is met.
- if(op.equals("?")) - break condition to exit loop.
- if(op.equals("+")) - condition to execute addition.
- if(op.equals("-")) - condition to execute subtraction.
- if(op.equals("*")) - condition to execute multiplication.
- if(op.equals("/")) - condition to execute division.

Input/output operations:
- Input: Reads three inputs in a loop - two integers and a string operator.
- Output: Prints the result of the arithmetic operation based on the operator.

Data processing logic:
- The program continuously reads arithmetic expressions from the user until the user inputs "?".
- Based on the operator, it performs the corresponding arithmetic operation and prints the result.

Required libraries:
- java.util.Scanner
