Function Signature: 
- `main(String[] args)`: void

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `sc`: Scanner
- `t`: int
- `count`: int[]

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. Create a new Scanner object `sc` to read input.
2. Read an integer `t` from the input.
3. Initialize an integer array `count` of size `t+1` with all elements set to 0.
4. Loop from `i = 2` to `i <= t`:
   - Read an integer from the input.
   - Increment the element at the index equal to the read integer in the `count` array.
5. Loop from `i = 1` to `i <= t`:
   - Print the value of the element at index `i` in the `count` array.

Control Structures:
- For loop with condition `i <= t` for initializing and reading input.
- For loop with condition `i <= t` for printing the count array.

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Read an integer `t` which represents the number of elements to process.
- Read `t-1` integers, each representing an index in the `count` array, and increment the corresponding element in the `count` array.
- Print the values of the `count` array from index `1` to `t`.

Required Libraries:
- `java.util.Scanner`
