Function signature: `main(String[] args)`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `Scanner sc` (Scanner)
- `long n` (long)
- `double sqrt` (double)
- `double nearNum` (double)
- `long ans` (long)

Execution order and logic flow:
1. Instantiate `Scanner` object `sc` for standard input.
2. Read a line from input, parse it as a `long`, and assign it to `n`.
3. Calculate the square root of `n` and assign it to `sqrt`.
4. Find the largest integer less than or equal to `sqrt` and assign it to `nearNum`.
5. Raise `nearNum` to the power of 2, cast the result to `long`, and assign it to `ans`.
6. Print the value of `ans`.
7. Close the `Scanner` object `sc`.
