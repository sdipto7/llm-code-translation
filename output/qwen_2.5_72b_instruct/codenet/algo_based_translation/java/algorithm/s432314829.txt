Function Signature:
- main(String[] args): void

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- Scanner stdIn: for reading input
- int n: first input integer, represents the size of the array minus one
- int m: second input integer, represents the number of obstacles
- int[] dp: array for dynamic programming storage, size n + 2
- int i: loop variable

Complete Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. Create a Scanner object to read from standard input.
2. Read the first integer n from input.
3. Read the second integer m from input.
4. Initialize an array dp of size n + 2.
5. Set dp[n + 1] to 0.
6. Set dp[n] to 1.
7. For i from 0 to m - 1:
   a. Read an integer from input and set dp at that index to -1.
8. For i from n - 1 to 0 (inclusive):
   a. If dp[i] is -1, set dp[i] to 0.
   b. Otherwise, set dp[i] to (dp[i + 1] + dp[i + 2]) modulo 1000000007.
9. Print the value of dp[0].

Control Structures:
- For loop (i from 0 to m - 1) for setting obstacles in dp array.
- For loop (i from n - 1 to 0) for filling dp array with possible paths.
- If-else condition inside the second for loop to check if dp[i] is -1.

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input: Two integers n and m, followed by m integers representing the obstacles.
- Output: A single integer, the number of ways to reach the end modulo 1000000007.

Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- java.util.Scanner
