- Function signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`

- Variable declarations and data types:
  - `int[] Num`
  - `Scanner n`

- Logic flow in execution order:
  - Initialize `Num` as an array of integers with size 11
  - Create a new `Scanner` object `n` for reading input from the standard input stream
  - For `i` from 0 to 9 (inclusive):
    - Read an integer from the standard input stream and assign it to `Num[i]`
  - For `a` from 9 to 0 (inclusive):
    - For `b` from 0 to `a-1` (inclusive):
      - If `Num[b]` is less than `Num[b+1]`:
        - Set `Num[10]` to `Num[b]`
        - Set `Num[b]` to `Num[b+1]`
        - Set `Num[b+1]` to `Num[10]`
  - Print `Num[0]`
  - Print `Num[1]`
  - Print `Num[2]`

- Control structures:
  - For loop with condition `i < 10` for reading input values
  - For loop with condition `a >= 0` for sorting
  - For loop with condition `b < a` for comparing and swapping elements
  - If statement with condition `Num[b] < Num[b+1]` for deciding whether to swap elements

- Input/output operations and data processing logic:
  - Input: 10 integers from the standard input stream
  - Output: The first three elements of the sorted array `Num`

- Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
  - `java.util.Scanner` for reading input from the standard input stream
