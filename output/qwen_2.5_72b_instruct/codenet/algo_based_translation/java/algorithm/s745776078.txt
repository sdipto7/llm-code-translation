Function Signatures:
- `main(String[] args)`: void

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `in`: Scanner
- `out`: PrintWriter
- `n`: int
- `m`: int
- `A`: int[][]
- `b`: int[]
- `i`: int
- `j`: int
- `c`: int

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize `in` as a Scanner object for input.
2. Initialize `out` as a PrintWriter object for output.
3. Read `n` as an integer.
4. Read `m` as an integer.
5. Declare a 2D array `A` of size `n` x `m`.
6. Declare a 1D array `b` of size `m`.
7. For `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
   1. For `j` from 0 to `m-1`:
      1. Read an integer and assign it to `A[i][j]`.
8. For `i` from 0 to `m-1`:
   1. Read an integer and assign it to `b[i]`.
9. For `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
   1. Initialize `c` to 0.
   2. For `j` from 0 to `m-1`:
      1. Multiply `A[i][j]` by `b[j]`.
      2. Add the result to `c`.
   3. Print `c` followed by a newline.
10. Flush `out` to ensure all output is written.

Input/Output Operations:
- Read integers from standard input.
- Print integers to standard output.

Data Processing Logic:
- Reads a matrix `A` of size `n` x `m`.
- Reads a vector `b` of size `m`.
- Computes the dot product of each row of `A` with `b`.
- Outputs the result of each dot product.

Libraries:
- `java.util.*` for `Scanner` and `PrintWriter`
- `java.io.*` for I/O operations
