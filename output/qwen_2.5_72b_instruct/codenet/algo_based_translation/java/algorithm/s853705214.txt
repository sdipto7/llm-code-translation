Function signatures with parameter and return types:
- main(String[] args): void

Variable declarations and data types:
- sc: Scanner
- n: int
- nums: int[]
- min: int
- countNegatives: int
- sum: long
- i: int
- num: int
- abs: int

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Initialize sc as a new Scanner object for standard input.
2. Read an integer n from sc.
3. Initialize nums as an integer array of size n.
4. Loop from i = 0 to n - 1:
   - Read an integer from sc and assign it to nums[i].
5. Initialize min as Integer.MAX_VALUE.
6. Initialize countNegatives as 0.
7. Initialize sum as 0.
8. Loop through each num in nums:
   - Calculate abs as the absolute value of num.
   - Add abs to sum.
   - Update min to be the smaller value between min and abs.
   - If num is less than 0, increment countNegatives by 1.
9. If countNegatives modulo 2 equals 0, print sum.
10. Otherwise, print sum minus (min * 2).

Control structures:
- for loop with condition i < n and increment i++.
- for-each loop iterating over nums.
- if statement with condition num < 0.
- ternary operator checking countNegatives % 2 == 0.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads n and n integers from standard input.
- Output: Prints the sum of absolute values or the adjusted sum based on the count of negative numbers.
- Data processing: Calculates the sum of absolute values, finds the minimum absolute value, counts negative numbers, and adjusts the sum if necessary.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- java.util.*
