- Function signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`
- Variable declarations and data types:
  - `Scanner sc` of type `Scanner`
  - `int n` for number of iterations
  - `int c` for consecutive match counter
  - `int flg` for flag indicating three consecutive matches
  - `int x` for first input number in each iteration
  - `int y` for second input number in each iteration
- Logic flow:
  - Create a `Scanner` object for reading input
  - Read an integer `n` which represents the number of iterations
  - Initialize `c` to 0
  - Initialize `flg` to 0
  - While `n` is greater than 0, decrement `n` by 1 in each iteration:
    - Read two integers `x` and `y`
    - If `x` is equal to `y`:
      - Increment `c` by 1
      - If `c` is greater than or equal to 3:
        - Set `flg` to 1
    - Else:
      - Set `c` to 0
  - If `flg` is 0:
    - Print "No"
  - Else:
    - Print "Yes"
- Input/output operations:
  - Read integers from standard input using `Scanner`
  - Print "No" or "Yes" to standard output
- Required libraries:
  - `java.util.*` for `Scanner` class
