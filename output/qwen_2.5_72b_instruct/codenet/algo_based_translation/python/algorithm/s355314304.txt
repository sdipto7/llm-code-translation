Function signature: `calculate_adjustment(n: int) -> int`

Variable declarations: 
- n: int
- result: int

Logic flow:
1. Read integer input from user and assign to n
2. If n modulo 1000 equals 0:
   - Set result to 0
3. Else:
   - Set result to 1000 minus (n modulo 1000)
4. Print result

Control structures:
- If-Else statement with condition `n % 1000 == 0`

Input/output operations:
- Read integer from input
- Print integer result

Data processing logic:
- Modulo operation to find remainder of n divided by 1000
- Arithmetic operation to calculate difference between 1000 and the remainder

Libraries/modules/dependencies:
- None required
