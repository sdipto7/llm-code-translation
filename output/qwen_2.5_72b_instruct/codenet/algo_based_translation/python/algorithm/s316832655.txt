Function signature: `calculate_triangle_area(a: int, b: int) -> int`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `a: int`
- `b: int`
- `c: int` (not used)
- `result: int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read input values as strings and split by whitespace.
2. Map the split string values to integers and unpack them into variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. Calculate the area of a triangle using the formula `(a * b) / 2` and store the result in `result`.
4. Print the integer value of `result`.

Control structures:
- No loops or conditionals present.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads a single line of input containing three space-separated integers.
- Output: Prints the integer value of the calculated triangle area.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required.
