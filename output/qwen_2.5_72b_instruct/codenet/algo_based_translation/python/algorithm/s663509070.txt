Function signature: `main() -> None`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `N: int`
- `D: int`
- `mat: List[List[int]]`
- `c: int`
- `dist: float`
- `i: int`
- `j: int`
- `x: int`
- `y: int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read two integers `N` and `D` from input.
2. Initialize an empty list `mat` to store the input matrices.
3. For each integer `d` in the range from 0 to `N-1`, read `D` integers from input, convert them to a list of integers, and append this list to `mat`.
4. Import the `math` module.
5. Initialize a counter variable `c` to 0.
6. For each integer `i` in the range from 0 to `len(mat)-2`:
   - For each integer `j` in the range from `i+1` to `len(mat)-1`:
     - Calculate the Euclidean distance `dist` between `mat[i]` and `mat[j]` using the formula `sqrt(sum([(x-y)**2 for x, y in zip(mat[i], mat[j])]))`.
     - If `dist` is an integer (i.e., `int(dist) == dist`), increment the counter `c` by 1.
7. Print the value of `c`.

Control structures:
- Loops: Two nested `for` loops.
- Conditionals: An `if` statement to check if `dist` is an integer.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read two integers `N` and `D`, then read `N` lines of `D` integers each.
- Data processing: Calculate Euclidean distances between all pairs of matrices and count how many of these distances are integers.
- Output: Print the count of integer distances.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `math` module for the `sqrt` function.
