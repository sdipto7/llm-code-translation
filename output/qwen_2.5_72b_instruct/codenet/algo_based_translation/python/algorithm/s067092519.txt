Function signature: `main()`

Variable declarations:
- `N` of type integer
- `m` of type list of lists of lists of integers, initialized as a 3D array with dimensions 10x3x10 filled with zeros
- `line` of type string, initialized as an empty string

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read an integer `N` from input
2. Initialize a 3D list `m` with dimensions 10x3x10 filled with zeros
3. For `i` from 0 to `N-1`:
   - Read a line of input, split it into a list `n` of strings
   - Convert the first element of `n` to integer and assign to `b`
   - Convert the second element of `n` to integer and assign to `f`
   - Convert the third element of `n` to integer and assign to `r`
   - Convert the fourth element of `n` to integer and assign to `v`
   - Increment `m[b-1][f-1][r-1]` by `v`
4. For `i` from 0 to 3:
   - For `j` from 0 to 2:
     - For `k` from 0 to 9:
       - Append a space and the value of `m[i][j][k]` as a string to `line`
     - Print `line`
     - Reset `line` to an empty string
   - If `i` is less than 3, print a string of 20 hash symbols (`#`)

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads an integer `N`, followed by `N` lines each containing four integers separated by spaces
- Output: Prints the 3D list `m` in a formatted manner, with each building's floors separated by a line of 20 hash symbols
