Function Signature: `main() -> None`
Variable Declarations: `h, a: int`, `ans: int`, `ama: int`

Logic Flow:
1. Read a line from standard input, strip whitespace, split by spaces, convert the resulting strings to integers, and assign them to `h` and `a` respectively.
2. Calculate the integer division of `h` by `a` and assign the result to `ans`.
3. Calculate the remainder of `h` divided by `a` and assign the result to `ama`.
4. If `ama` is not equal to 0:
   - Increment `ans` by 1.
5. Print the value of `ans` to standard output.
