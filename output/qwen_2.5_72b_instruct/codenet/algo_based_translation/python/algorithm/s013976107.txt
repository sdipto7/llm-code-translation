Function Signature: check_expression() -> None

Variable Declarations:
- A: Integer
- B: Integer
- S: List of Characters

Logic Flow:
1. Read input values
2. Split input into two integers A and B
3. Read the next line of input as a string and convert it into a list of characters S
4. Check if the A-th element of S is a hyphen ('-')
5. Count the number of hyphens ('-') in the list S
6. If the A-th element of S is a hyphen ('-') and the total count of hyphens in S is exactly 1, print "Yes"
7. Otherwise, print "No"

Control Structures:
- Conditional: if S[A] == '-' and S.count('-') == 1

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Two integers A and B, and a string
- Output: "Yes" or "No"

Data Processing Logic:
- Splitting input string into integers
- Converting input string into a list of characters
- Accessing elements in a list by index
- Counting occurrences of a specific character in a list

Required Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- None
