Function signature: `check_string() -> None`

Variable declarations:
- `s`: List[str]

Logic flow:
1. Read a string input from the user
2. Convert the input string to a list of characters and assign it to `s`
3. Sort the list `s` in ascending order
4. Check if the first element of `s` is equal to the second element and not equal to the third element, and if the third element is equal to the fourth element
5. If the condition in step 4 is true, print "Yes"
6. If the condition in step 4 is false, print "No"

Control structures:
- Conditional: `if s[0] == s[1] and s[0] != s[2] and s[2] == s[3]:`

Input/output operations:
- Input: Read a string from the user using `input()`
- Output: Print "Yes" or "No" based on the condition

Data processing logic:
- Convert string to list of characters
- Sort the list

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No specific imports required
