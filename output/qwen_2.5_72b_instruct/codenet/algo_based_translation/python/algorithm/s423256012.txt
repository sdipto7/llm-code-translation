- Function Signature: `main()` (no parameters, no return type)
- Variable Declarations: `A` (integer), `B` (integer)
- Logic Flow:
  1. Read input as a single line and split into two parts.
  2. Convert the two parts from strings to integers and assign them to variables `A` and `B`.
  3. Calculate the sum of `A` and `B`.
  4. Check if the sum is odd:
     - If true, print the string 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
     - If false, calculate the integer division of the sum by 2 and print the result.
- Control Structures:
  - Conditional: `if (A+B)%2 == 1` (check if the sum of `A` and `B` is odd)
- Input/Output Operations:
  - Input: Read a single line of input, split it into two parts, and convert them to integers.
  - Output: Print either 'IMPOSSIBLE' or the result of `(A+B)//2`.
- Libraries/Modules/Dependencies: None required
