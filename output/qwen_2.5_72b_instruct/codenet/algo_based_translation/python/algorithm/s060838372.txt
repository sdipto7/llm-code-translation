Function Signature: `transform_string(N: int, K: int, S: str) -> str`

Variable Declarations:
- N: int
- K: int
- S: list of str
- ans: str

Logic Flow:
1. Read integers N and K from input, separated by whitespace.
2. Read string S from input.
3. Convert string S into a list of characters.
4. If the character at index K-1 in S is "A", replace it with "a".
5. Else if the character at index K-1 in S is "B", replace it with "b".
6. Else, replace the character at index K-1 in S with "c".
7. Join the list S back into a string and assign it to ans.
8. Print the string ans.

Control Structures:
- If-elif-else statement to check the value of the character at index K-1 in S and replace it accordingly.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Two integers N and K, followed by a string S.
- Output: The modified string S with the character at index K-1 transformed to lowercase ('a', 'b', or 'c').

Data Processing Logic:
- Convert the input string S into a list to enable modification of specific characters.
- Modify the character at the specified index K-1 based on its current value.
- Convert the list back to a string for output.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules are required.
