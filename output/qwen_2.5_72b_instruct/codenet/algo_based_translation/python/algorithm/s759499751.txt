Function Signature: `main() -> None`

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `n: int`
- `k: int`
- `a: List[str]`
- `c: List[int]`
- `i: int`
- `w: int`
- `l: int`
- `r: int`

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. Read two integers `n` and `k` from input.
2. Read a string and convert it into a list of characters `a` of length `n`.
3. Initialize a list `c` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
4. Loop through the list `a` starting from index 1 to `n-1`:
    - If the current character `a[i]` is "C" and the previous character `a[i-1]` is "A":
        - Set `c[i]` to `c[i-1] + 1`.
    - Otherwise:
        - Set `c[i]` to `c[i-1]`.
5. Loop `k` times:
    - Read two integers `l` and `r` from input.
    - Print the result of `c[r-1] - c[l-1]`.

Control Structures:
- For loop: from `1` to `n-1` for processing the list `a`.
- For loop: from `0` to `k-1` for handling `k` queries.
- If-else statement: to check if the current character is "C" and the previous character is "A".

Input/Output Operations:
- Read `n` and `k` from standard input.
- Read the string and convert it to a list of characters.
- Read `l` and `r` for each of the `k` queries.
- Print the result of `c[r-1] - c[l-1]` for each query.

Data Processing Logic:
- Count the number of "AC" pairs in the list `a` up to each index and store the cumulative count in the list `c`.
- For each query, calculate the number of "AC" pairs in the substring `a[l-1:r]` by subtracting the cumulative count at index `l-2` from the cumulative count at index `r-1`.

Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- `sys` (implicitly used for input)
- `typing` (for type hints, not explicitly used in the code)
