Function Signature: `main()`

Variable Declarations:
- `N` of type `int`
- `S` of type `str`
- `T` of type `str`
- `char_lists` of type `list` of `str`

Logic Flow:
1. Read an integer `N` from input.
2. Read a string `S` and a string `T` from input, split by space.
3. Initialize an empty list `char_lists`.
4. For each index `i` and character `char` in the string `S`:
   - Append `char` to `char_lists`.
   - Append character at index `i` of `T` to `char_lists`.
5. Join all elements in `char_lists` into a single string and print it.

Control Structures:
- For loop with condition `for i, char in enumerate(S)`

Input/Output Operations:
- Read `N` using `input()` and convert to `int`.
- Read `S` and `T` using `input()` and split by space.
- Print the joined string of `char_lists`.

Data Processing Logic:
- Iterate over each character in `S` and corresponding character in `T` to interleave them in `char_lists`.

Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules required.
