Function signature: `process_numbers()`

Variable declarations:
- `n` of type `int`
- `l` of type `list` of `str`
- `max` of type `float` initialized to `-1e9`
- `min` of type `float` initialized to `1e9`
- `sum` of type `int` initialized to `0`

Execution order and logic flow:
1. Read an integer `n` from input.
2. Read a line of input, split by spaces, and store in list `l`.
3. Initialize `max` to `-1e9`, `min` to `1e9`, and `sum` to `0`.
4. Loop over the range from `0` to `n` (exclusive):
   - Convert `l[i]` to `int` and add to `sum`.
   - If `int(l[i])` is greater than `max`, update `max` to `int(l[i])`.
   - If `int(l[i])` is less than `min`, update `min` to `int(l[i])`.
5. Print `min`, `max`, and `sum`.

Control structures:
- For loop iterating from `0` to `n-1`.
- If statements to update `max` and `min`.

Input/output operations:
- Read an integer `n` from input.
- Read a space-separated string, split into a list of strings `l`.
- Print the values of `min`, `max`, and `sum`.

Data processing logic:
- Convert each element of `l` to an integer for comparison and summation.
- Track the maximum and minimum values encountered.
- Accumulate the sum of all integer values.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- None needed beyond standard Python libraries.
