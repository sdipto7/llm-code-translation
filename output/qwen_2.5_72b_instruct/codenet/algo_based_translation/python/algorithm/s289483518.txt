Function signature: `main() -> None`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `n: int`
- `m: int`
- `a: List[int]`
- `ope: List[List[int]]`
- `j: int`

Logic flow in execution order:
- Read integers `n` and `m` from input.
- Read a list of integers `a` of length `n` from input.
- Sort list `a` in ascending order.
- Read `m` operations into a list of lists `ope`, where each operation contains two integers.
- Sort list `ope` in descending order based on the second element of each sublist.
- Initialize `j` to 0.
- For each index `i` in the range of `n`:
    - If `a[i]` is less than `ope[j][1]`:
        - Set `a[i]` to `ope[j][1]`.
        - Decrement `ope[j][0]` by 1.
        - If `ope[j][0]` equals 0:
            - Increment `j` by 1.
            - If `j` equals the length of `ope`:
                - Break the loop.
    - Else:
        - Break the loop.
- Print the sum of list `a`.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input reading for `n` and `m`.
- Input reading for list `a`.
- Input reading for list `ope`.
- Sorting operations on `a` and `ope`.
- Loop through `a` and apply operations based on conditions.
- Summing the elements of `a` and printing the result.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `List` from `typing` module
