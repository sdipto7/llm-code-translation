Function Signature: calculate_difference(X: int, t: int) -> int

Variable Declarations:
- X: int
- t: int
- answer: int

Execution Order:
1. Read input values as a single line, split by space, and map both to integers. Assign the first value to X and the second to t.
2. If X is greater than t, compute the difference between X and t, assign the result to answer.
3. If X is less than or equal to t, assign 0 to answer.
4. Print the value of answer.

Control Structures:
- If condition: X > t
- Else if condition: X <= t

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read a single line of input containing two space-separated integers.
- Output: Print a single integer representing the computed answer.

Data Processing Logic:
- Compare the values of X and t.
- Compute the difference if X is greater than t.
- Assign 0 if X is less than or equal to t.
- Output the result.

Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules required.
