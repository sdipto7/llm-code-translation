Function signatures with parameter and return types:
- No explicit function signatures in the provided code

Variable declarations and data types:
- `X: iterator` (created from standard input)
- `h: int` (height of the matrix)
- `w: int` (width of the matrix)
- `C: np.ndarray` (10x10 matrix of integers for costs)
- `A: np.ndarray` (h x w matrix of integers representing the grid)
- `G: nx.DiGraph` (directed graph created from matrix C)
- `d: dict` (dictionary for storing shortest path lengths)
- `s: int` (sum of shortest path lengths)

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Read dimensions `h` and `w` from input.
2. Initialize a 10x10 matrix `C` with zeros.
3. Fill matrix `C` with values from input.
4. Initialize a h x w matrix `A` with zeros.
5. Fill matrix `A` with values from input.
6. Create a directed graph `G` from matrix `C` where each element represents the weight of an edge.
7. Initialize an empty dictionary `d`.
8. For each integer `i` from 0 to 9 (inclusive):
   - If `i` is 1, skip the current iteration.
   - Calculate the shortest path length from `i` to 1 in graph `G` using Dijkstra's algorithm and store it in dictionary `d` with key `i`.
9. Initialize an integer `s` to 0.
10. For each element `a` in a flattened version of matrix `A`:
    - If `a` is -1 or 1, skip the current iteration.
    - Add the shortest path length from `a` to 1 (retrieved from dictionary `d`) to `s`.
11. Output the value of `s`.

Control structures:
- Loops:
  - `for i in range(10)`
  - `for j, c in enumerate(...)`
  - `for i in range(h)`
  - `for j, a in enumerate(...)`
  - `for a in chain.from_iterable(A)`
- Conditionals:
  - `if i == 1: continue`
  - `if a == -1 or a == 1: continue`

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read dimensions `h` and `w`, then read `C` and `A` matrices from standard input.
- Output: Print the sum of shortest path lengths `s`.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `itertools.chain`
- `numpy` (as `np`)
- `networkx` (as `nx`)
