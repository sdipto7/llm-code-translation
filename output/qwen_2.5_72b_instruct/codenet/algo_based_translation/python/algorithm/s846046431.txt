Function Signature: main() -> None

Variable Declarations:
- N: int
- M: int
- A: List[int]
- S: int
- a: int

Complete Logic Flow:
1. Read integers N and M from standard input
2. Read a list of N integers A from standard input
3. Sort list A in descending order
4. Calculate the sum of elements in A and store it in S
5. For each element a in the first M elements of A:
   - If (a / S) - (1 / (4 * M)) is less than 0:
     - Print 'No'
     - Break out of loop
6. If loop completes without breaking:
   - Print 'Yes'

Control Structures:
- For loop iterating over A[:M] with condition (a / S) - (1 / (4 * M)) < 0
- If statement inside for loop with condition (a / S) - (1 / (4 * M)) < 0

Input/Output Operations:
- Read N and M from standard input
- Read list A from standard input
- Print 'No' or 'Yes' to standard output

Data Processing Logic:
- Sorting list A in descending order
- Calculating sum S of elements in A
- Iterating through the first M elements of A
- Performing arithmetic operations to check the condition (a / S) - (1 / (4 * M))

Required Libraries/Modules:
- sys module for reading input from standard input
