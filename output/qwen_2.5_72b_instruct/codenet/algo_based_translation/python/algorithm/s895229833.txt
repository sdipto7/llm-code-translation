Function signature: `find_longest_non_increasing_subsequence_length(N: int, heights: List[int]) -> int`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `N: int`
- `heights: List[int]`
- `count_best: int`
- `count_tmp: int`
- `i: int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read an integer `N` from input.
2. Read a list of integers `heights` of length `N` from input.
3. Initialize `count_best` to 0.
4. Initialize `count_tmp` to 0.
5. For each index `i` from 0 to `N-2`:
   - If `heights[i]` is greater than or equal to `heights[i+1]`:
     - Increment `count_tmp` by 1.
   - Else:
     - If `count_tmp` is greater than `count_best`:
       - Set `count_best` to `count_tmp`.
     - Set `count_tmp` to 0.
6. After the loop, if `count_tmp` is greater than `count_best`:
   - Set `count_best` to `count_tmp`.
7. Print `count_best`.

Control structures:
- For loop with condition `i` from 0 to `N-2`.
- If-else statement with condition `heights[i] >= heights[i+1]`.
- Nested if statement with condition `count_tmp > count_best`.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers.
- Output: Prints the length of the longest non-increasing subsequence in the list.
- Data processing: Iterates through the list to count the length of non-increasing subsequences and keeps track of the maximum length found.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `List` from `typing` module for type annotation.
