Function signature: main() -> None
Variable declarations: A: int, B: int
Logic flow:
1. Read input from standard input as a string
2. Split the string by whitespace to obtain two substrings
3. Convert the first substring to an integer and assign it to A
4. Convert the second substring to an integer and assign it to B
5. Multiply A and B and print the result to standard output
