Function Signatures:
- main() -> None

Variable Declarations:
- n: int
- ls: List[List[int]]
- taka: int
- aoki: int
- i: int

Logic Flow:
1. Read an integer n from the input.
2. Initialize an empty list ls.
3. For i from 0 to n-1:
   a. Read a line of input, split it into a list of integers, and append it to ls.
4. Sort ls in descending order based on the sum of the sublists.
5. Initialize taka to 0.
6. For i from 0 to len(ls)-1, incrementing by 2:
   a. Add the first element of ls[i] to taka.
7. Initialize aoki to 0.
8. For i from 1 to len(ls)-1, incrementing by 2:
   a. Add the second element of ls[i] to aoki.
9. Print the result of taka minus aoki.

Input/Output Operations:
- Read integer n from input.
- Read n lines of input, each containing space-separated integers.
- Print the integer result of taka minus aoki.

Data Processing Logic:
- The list ls is sorted based on the sum of its sublists in descending order.
- The sum of every other element starting from the first element of the sorted list is calculated for taka.
- The sum of every other element starting from the second element of the sorted list is calculated for aoki.

Required Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- None
