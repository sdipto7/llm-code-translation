Function signature: main() -> None

Variable declarations and data types:
N: int
A: list[int]
B: list[int]
ans: int
i: int
d: int

Logic flow in execution order:
- Read integer N from input
- Read list A of integers from input
- Read list B of integers from input
- Initialize ans to 0
- For i from 0 to N-1:
    - Set d to minimum of A[i] and B[i]
    - Add d to ans
    - Subtract d from A[i]
    - Subtract d from B[i]
    - Set d to minimum of A[i + 1] and B[i]
    - Add d to ans
    - Subtract d from A[i + 1]
    - Subtract d from B[i]
- Print value of ans

Control structures:
- For loop: for i in range(N)

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read integer N, then read two lines of space-separated integers for lists A and B
- Output: Print single integer representing the value of ans

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries, modules, or dependencies required
