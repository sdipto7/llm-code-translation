Function: main()
Parameters: None
Return Type: None

Variable Declarations:
- candy: List[int]

Logic Flow:
1. Read a line of input
2. Split the input line into a list of strings
3. Convert each string in the list to an integer
4. Sort the list of integers and assign it to the variable candy
5. Check if the sum of the first and second elements of candy is equal to the third element of candy
6. If the condition is true, print "Yes"
7. If the condition is false, print "No"

Control Structures:
- Conditional: if candy[0] + candy[1] == candy[2] then print "Yes" else print "No"

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read a line of input from the user
- Output: Print "Yes" or "No" based on the condition

Data Processing Logic:
- Conversion of input strings to integers
- Sorting the list of integers

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required
