Function signature: `main() -> None`

Variable declarations:
- `n: int`
- `r: int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read an integer `n` from standard input.
2. Initialize `r` to 0.
3. Loop from `ii = 0` to `ii < n`:
   a. If `ii + 1` is not divisible by 3 and `ii + 1` is not divisible by 5:
      i. Add `ii + 1` to `r`.
4. Print the value of `r`.

Control structures:
- For loop: `for ii in range(n)`
- Conditional statement: `if (ii+1)%3!=0 and (ii+1)%5!=0`

Input/output operations:
- Input: Read integer `n` from standard input.
- Output: Print the integer value of `r`.

Data processing logic:
- Sum integers from 1 to `n` that are not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required.
