Function signature: `main()`
Variable declarations:
- `N` as integer
- `A` as list of integers
- `s` as integer
- `B` as list of integers
- `L` as list of strings

Logic flow:
1. Read integer `N` from input
2. Read `N` space-separated integers and store in list `A`
3. Initialize `s` with the XOR of the first two elements of `A` (`A[0] ^ A[1]`)
4. For `i` from 2 to `N-1` (inclusive):
   - Update `s` with `s` XOR `A[i]`
5. Initialize list `B` of size `N` with all elements set to 0
6. For `i` from 0 to `N-1` (inclusive):
   - Set `B[i]` to `s` XOR `A[i]`
7. Convert each element of `B` to string and store in list `L`
8. Join elements of `L` with space separator to form a single string
9. Print the resulting string
