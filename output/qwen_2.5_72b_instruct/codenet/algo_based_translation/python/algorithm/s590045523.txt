Function Signature: `main()` with no parameters and no return type

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `N` as integer
- `L` as list of integers
- `ans` as integer

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. Read an integer `N` from input
2. Read a space-separated list of integers into list `L`
3. Initialize `ans` to 0
4. Begin outer loop with `i` from 0 to `N-3` (inclusive)
5. Begin middle loop with `j` from `i+1` to `N-2` (inclusive)
6. Begin inner loop with `k` from `j+1` to `N-1` (inclusive)
7. Assign `a` to `L[i]`
8. Assign `b` to `L[j]`
9. Assign `c` to `L[k]`
10. If `a` equals `b` or `b` equals `c` or `c` equals `a`, continue to next iteration of inner loop
11. If `a + b > c` and `b + c > a` and `c + a > b`, increment `ans` by 1
12. End inner loop
13. End middle loop
14. End outer loop
15. Print value of `ans`

Control Structures:
- Outer `for` loop with condition `i` ranging from 0 to `N-3`
- Middle `for` loop with condition `j` ranging from `i+1` to `N-2`
- Inner `for` loop with condition `k` ranging from `j+1` to `N-1`
- `if` statement with condition `a == b or b == c or c == a`
- `if` statement with condition `a + b > c and b + c > a and c + a > b`

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input read operations for `N` and `L`
- Output print operation for `ans`
- Data processing logic involves iterating through combinations of three elements in `L` to check if they form a valid triangle

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No specific imports required beyond default Python functionality
