Function signature: `main() -> None`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `A: int`
- `B: int`
- `C: int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read three integers from standard input and assign them to variables `A`, `B`, and `C`.
2. Check if `B` is less than `C`.
   - If true, print `0` and exit.
3. Check if the product of `A` and `C` is less than `B`.
   - If true, print `C` and exit.
4. Otherwise, print the integer division of `B` by `A`.

Control structures:
- Conditional: `if B < C`
- Conditional: `elif A * C < B`
- Conditional: `else`

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read three space-separated integers from standard input.
- Output: Print an integer based on the conditions specified.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No specific imports required. Uses built-in functions `map`, `int`, and `input`.
