Function signature: `calculate_area(H: int, W: int, h: int, w: int) -> int`

Variable declarations and data types:
- H: int
- W: int
- h: int
- w: int
- ans: int

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read two integers H and W from standard input.
2. Read two integers h and w from standard input.
3. Calculate the area of the outer rectangle using the formula H * W.
4. Calculate the overlapping area of the inner rectangles using the formula h * W + w * H - h * w.
5. Subtract the overlapping area from the area of the outer rectangle to get ans.
6. Print the value of ans.

Control structures:
- No loops or conditionals present.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
1. Input: Two lines of space-separated integers.
2. Output: A single integer representing the calculated area.
