Function signature: `calculate_stones(N: int, A: int, B: int) -> int`

Variable declarations:
- `N: int`
- `A: int`
- `B: int`
- `ans: int`

Logic flow:
1. Read input values `N`, `A`, `B` as integers from the standard input.
2. Calculate the integer division of `N` by the sum of `A` and `B` and multiply the result by `A`.
3. Calculate the remainder of `N` divided by the sum of `A` and `B`.
4. Determine the minimum value between `A` and the remainder calculated in step 3.
5. Add the result from step 2 to the result from step 4 and store the sum in `ans`.
6. Print the value of `ans` to the standard output.

Input/output operations:
- Input: Read a single line from the standard input containing three space-separated integers `N`, `A`, `B`.
- Output: Print a single integer `ans` to the standard output.

Data processing logic:
- Use integer division to determine how many complete cycles of `A` stones can be taken.
- Calculate the remaining stones after the complete cycles.
- Determine the number of additional stones that can be taken from the remaining stones, which is the minimum of `A` and the remaining stones.
- Sum the stones from complete cycles and additional stones to get the final answer.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- None
