Function signature:
- `is_divisible_by_nine(N: int) -> None`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `N: int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to `N`.
2. Check if `N` is divisible by 9 using the condition `N % 9 == 0`.
3. If the condition is true, print 'Yes'.
4. If the condition is false, print 'No'.

Control structures:
- Conditional (if-else) with condition `N % 9 == 0`.

Input/output operations:
- Input: Read an integer from the user.
- Output: Print 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition.

Data processing logic:
- Calculate the remainder of `N` divided by 9.
- Compare the remainder with 0 to determine divisibility.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules are required.
