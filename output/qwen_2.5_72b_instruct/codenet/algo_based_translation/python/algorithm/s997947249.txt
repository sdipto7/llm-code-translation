Function signature: `main() -> None`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `N: int`
- `K: int`

Execution order and logic flow:
1. Read input values for `N` and `K` as integers.
2. Check if `N` modulo `K` equals 0.
3. If true, print 0.
4. Otherwise, print 1.

Control structures:
- Conditional statement: `if N % K == 0:`

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read two integers `N` and `K` from standard input.
- Output: Print either 0 or 1 based on the condition.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required.
