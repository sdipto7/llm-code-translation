Function signature:
- Function name: main
- Parameters: None
- Return type: None

Variable declarations and data types:
- A: integer
- B: integer
- lst: list of integers

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read input from standard input, split it into two parts, convert each part to an integer, and assign them to A and B respectively.
2. Initialize an empty list named lst.
3. Compute the sum of A and B, convert the result to an integer, and append it to lst.
4. Compute the difference between A and B, convert the result to an integer, and append it to lst.
5. Compute the product of A and B, convert the result to an integer, and append it to lst.
6. Find the maximum value in lst and print it to standard output.

Control structures:
- No loops are present.
- No conditionals are present.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read two integers from standard input separated by whitespace.
- Output: Print the maximum value from the list lst to standard output.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules are required.
