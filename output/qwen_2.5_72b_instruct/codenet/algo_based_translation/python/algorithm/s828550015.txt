Function signature: main() -> None

Variable declarations:
x: int
y: int
a: int
b: int
c: int
p: List[int]
q: List[int]
r: List[int]
pq: List[int]

Logic flow:
1. Read six integers from input and assign them to x, y, a, b, c
2. Read next x integers from input, sort them in descending order, and take the first x elements, assign to p
3. Read next y integers from input, sort them in descending order, and take the first y elements, assign to q
4. Read next integers from input, sort them in descending order, assign to r
5. Concatenate p and q, sort the result in ascending order, assign to pq
6. For i from 0 to min(x+y, a, b, c) - 1 do
   a. If pq[i] < r[i] then
      i. Assign r[i] to pq[i]
7. Print the sum of pq
