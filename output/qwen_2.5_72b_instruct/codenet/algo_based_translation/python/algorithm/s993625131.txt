Function: find_max_consecutive_dna_length
Parameters: S (List[str])
Return Type: int

Variable Declarations:
S (List[str])
count (int)
record (int)

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize S as a list of characters from input string
2. Initialize count to 0
3. Initialize record to 0
4. For each character in S from index 0 to length of S - 1:
    a. If the character is "A" or "C" or "G" or "T":
        i. Increment count by 1
    b. Else:
        i. If count is greater than record:
            1. Set record to count
        ii. Set count to 0
5. If count is greater than record:
    a. Set record to count
6. Print record
