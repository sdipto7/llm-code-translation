- Function signatures:
  - `gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int`
  - `lcm(a: int, b: int) -> int`

- Variable declarations and data types:
  - `n: int`
  - `m: int`
  - `s: str`
  - `t: str`
  - `aa: int`
  - `bb: int`
  - `cc: int`
  - `i: int`

- Logic flow in execution order:
  1. Read two integers `n` and `m` from standard input.
  2. Read two strings `s` and `t` from standard input.
  3. Calculate `aa` as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `m`.
  4. Calculate `bb` as the least common multiple (LCM) of `n` and `m`.
  5. Calculate `cc` as the integer division of `aa` by `bb`.
  6. Loop over the range of `aa` with variable `i`:
     - Check if the character at index `n//aa*i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `m//aa*i` in string `t`.
     - If they are not equal, print `-1` and exit the program.
  7. If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, print `bb`.

- Control structures:
  - Conditional: `if a < b: return gcd(b, a)`
  - Conditional: `if b == 0: return a`
  - Loop: `for i in range(aa):`
  - Conditional inside loop: `if s[n//aa*i] != t[m//aa*i]:`

- Input/output operations and data processing logic:
  - Input: Read two integers `n` and `m` using `il()` function.
  - Input: Read two strings `s` and `t` using `input()` function.
  - Output: Print `-1` if a mismatch is found between characters of `s` and `t`.
  - Output: Print `bb` if no mismatches are found.

- Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
  - `sys` module for `stdin`
