Function signature: `main()`

Variable declarations:
- `n` as integer
- `s` as string
- `ans` as integer
- `i` as integer (loop variable)
- `x` as set
- `y` as set
- `z` as integer
- `w` as character (loop variable)

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Read integer input and assign to `n`
2. Read string input and assign to `s`
3. Initialize `ans` to 0
4. For each `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
   - Create set `x` from substring `s[0:i+1]`
   - Create set `y` from substring `s[i+1:n]`
   - Initialize `z` to 0
   - For each character `w` in `x`:
     - If `w` is in `y`:
       - Increment `z` by 1
   - If `z` is greater than `ans`:
     - Assign `z` to `ans`
5. Print `ans`

Control structures:
- For loop: `for i in range(n)`
- For loop: `for w in x`
- If condition: `if w in y`
- If condition: `if z > ans`

Input/output operations:
- Read integer input
- Read string input
- Print integer `ans`

Data processing logic:
- Convert substrings to sets
- Find common characters between two sets
- Count and update the maximum count of common characters

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required
