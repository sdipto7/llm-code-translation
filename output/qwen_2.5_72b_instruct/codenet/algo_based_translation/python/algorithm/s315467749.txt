Function signature: `main() -> None`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `n: int`
- `S: List[int]`
- `q: int`
- `T: List[int]`
- `ans: int`
- `i: int`
- `left: int`
- `right: int`
- `mid: int`

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Read integer `n` from input.
2. Read list `S` of integers from input, split by spaces.
3. Read integer `q` from input.
4. Read list `T` of integers from input, split by spaces.
5. Initialize `ans` to 0.
6. For each integer `i` in `T`:
   1. If `i` equals last element of `S` or first element of `S`, increment `ans` by 1.
   2. Otherwise:
      1. Set `left` to 0.
      2. Set `right` to `n-1`.
      3. While `right-left` is greater than 1:
         1. Calculate `mid` as integer division of `(left+right)` by 2.
         2. If `S[mid]` equals `i`, increment `ans` by 1 and break the loop.
         3. Else if `S[mid]` is less than `i`, set `left` to `mid`.
         4. Else, set `right` to `mid`.
7. Print `ans`.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Four lines of integers, where the first line is `n`, the second line contains `n` space-separated integers for `S`, the third line is `q`, and the fourth line contains `q` space-separated integers for `T`.
- Output: A single integer representing the count of elements in `T` that are either the first or last element of `S` or exist in `S` between the first and last elements using binary search.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `List` from `typing` module (implied by `List[int]` type hint)
