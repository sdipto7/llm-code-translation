Function Signature: `main()`
Variable Declarations:
- `K`: integer
- `N`: integer
- `A`: list of integers
- `dist`: list of integers
- `maxv`: integer

Logic Flow:
1. Import `sys` module
2. Define `input` lambda function to read a line from standard input and strip newline characters
3. Define `input_nums` lambda function to read a line from standard input, split by spaces, convert each split element to an integer, and return a list of these integers
4. In `main` function:
   - Read and unpack first line of input into `K` and `N`
   - Read second line of input into list `A`
   - Initialize empty list `dist`
   - Loop through indices of `A` from 0 to length of `A` minus 2:
     - Append difference between `A[i+1]` and `A[i]` to `dist`
   - Append sum of `K`, `A[0]`, and negative `A[-1]` to `dist`
   - Find maximum value in `dist` and assign to `maxv`
   - Print result of sum of all elements in `dist` minus `maxv`

Input/Output Operations:
- Read two integers from standard input, representing `K` and `N`
- Read list of integers from standard input, representing positions `A`
- Print single integer, representing the calculated result

Required Libraries/Modules:
- `sys` module
