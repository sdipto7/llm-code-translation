Function Signature: 
- main() -> None

Variable Declarations:
- n: Integer
- m: Integer
- a: List of Integers
- b: List of Integers
- i: Integer
- a1: Integer
- b1: Integer

Logic Flow:
1. Read two integers from input and assign them to n and m respectively.
2. Initialize an empty list a.
3. Initialize an empty list b.
4. For i from 0 to m-1:
    1. Read two integers from input and assign them to a1 and b1 respectively.
    2. Append a1 to list a.
    3. Append b1 to list b.
5. For i from 1 to n:
    1. Count the occurrences of i in list a.
    2. Count the occurrences of i in list b.
    3. Sum the results of step 5.1 and 5.2.
    4. Print the result of step 5.3.

Input/Output Operations:
- Read input values for n and m.
- Read input values for a1 and b1 inside the loop.
- Print the sum of occurrences of each integer from 1 to n in lists a and b.

Data Processing Logic:
- Count occurrences of each integer from 1 to n in both lists a and b.
- Sum these occurrences and print the result for each integer.

Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules are required.
