Function signature: `main() -> None`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `N: int`
- `L: int`
- `S: List[str]`

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Read two integers `N` and `L` from the input.
2. Initialize an empty list `S` to store strings.
3. Loop `N` times:
   - Read a string from the input, strip the newline character, and append it to `S`.
4. Sort the list `S` in lexicographical order.
5. Join all elements of `S` into a single string without separators.
6. Print the resulting string.

Control structures:
- A for loop that iterates `N` times to read and store strings in `S`.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads two integers followed by `N` strings.
- Output: Prints a single string which is the concatenation of all sorted strings.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `sys` module is implicitly used for input operations.
- `typing.List` is used for type hinting the list `S`.
