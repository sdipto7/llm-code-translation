Function signature: `main() -> None`

Variable declarations:
- N: int
- x: int
- a: List[int]
- cnt: int
- i: int
- tmp: int

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read two integers N and x from input.
2. Read a list of N integers into list a.
3. Initialize counter cnt to 0.
4. Loop over indices from 1 to N-1 (inclusive):
   - Calculate the sum of the current element and the previous element, store in tmp.
   - If tmp is greater than x:
     - If tmp - x is greater than the current element:
       - Set the previous element to tmp - current element - x.
       - Set the current element to 0.
     - Else:
       - Subtract tmp - x from the current element.
     - Add tmp - x to cnt.
5. Print the value of cnt.
