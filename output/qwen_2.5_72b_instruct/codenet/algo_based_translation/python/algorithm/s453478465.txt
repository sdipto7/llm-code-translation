Function signature: main() -> None

Variable declarations:
- a: int
- b: int

Execution order:
1. Read input string and split it into two parts
2. Convert each part of the split string to integers and assign them to variables a and b respectively
3. Check if a is less than or equal to 8 and b is less than or equal to 8
   - If true, print "Yay!"
   - Otherwise, print ":("

Control structures:
- Conditional: if a <= 8 and b <= 8

Input/output operations:
- Input: Read a line from standard input, expected to contain two integers separated by whitespace
- Output: Print "Yay!" if both conditions are met, otherwise print ":("

Data processing logic:
- Splitting the input string into components
- Converting string components to integers
- Evaluating boolean expression

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required
