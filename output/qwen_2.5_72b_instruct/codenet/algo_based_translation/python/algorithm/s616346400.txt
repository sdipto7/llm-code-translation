Function signature:
- Function name: atc_079a
- Parameter: input_value (type: str)
- Return type: str

Variable declarations and data types:
- n (type: int)

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Assign the integer value 3 to the variable n.
2. Start a for loop with i ranging from 0 to len(input_value) - n (inclusive).
3. Inside the outer loop, start a for loop with j ranging from 1 to n - 1 (inclusive).
4. Inside the inner loop, check if the character at index i in input_value is not equal to the character at index i + j in input_value.
5. If the characters are not equal, break out of the inner loop.
6. If j reaches n - 1 and the loop completes without breaking, return the string "Yes".
7. If the outer loop completes without returning "Yes", return the string "No".

Control structures:
- For loop with range from 0 to len(input_value) - n (inclusive) for variable i.
- For loop with range from 1 to n - 1 (inclusive) for variable j.
- If statement to compare characters at index i and i + j in input_value.
- Break statement to exit the inner loop if characters are not equal.
- If statement to check if j has reached n - 1 and the loop completed without breaking, then return "Yes".

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Read a string from standard input and assign it to the variable input_value.
- Call the function atc_079a with input_value as the argument.
- Print the result returned by the function atc_079a.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No external libraries, modules, or dependencies are required.
