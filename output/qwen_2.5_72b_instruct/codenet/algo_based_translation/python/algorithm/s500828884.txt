Function Signature:
- Function name: calculate_minimum_cost
- Parameters: n (int), a (int), b (int)
- Return type: int

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- n: int
- a: int
- b: int
- cost: int

Logic Flow:
1. Input operation: Read a line of input from the user containing three space-separated integers and assign them to variables n, a, and b.
2. Data processing logic: Calculate the minimum cost by comparing the product of n and a with b.
3. Output operation: Print the minimum cost.

Control Structures:
- Conditional structure: Use the min function to determine the smaller value between n * a and b.

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
1. Read the input values as a single line of space-separated integers.
2. Split the input line into three separate strings.
3. Convert the three strings into integers n, a, and b.
4. Compute the cost as the minimum of n * a and b.
5. Output the computed cost to the console.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules are required. The code uses built-in Python functions.
