Function signature: `main()`

Variable declarations:
- `n` as integer
- `s` as string
- `left` as integer initialized to 0
- `left1` as integer initialized to 0
- `right1` as integer initialized to 0
- `i` as string (used in loop iteration)

Input operations:
- Read integer `n` from standard input
- Read string `s` from standard input

Logic flow:
1. Loop through each character `i` in string `s`:
   - If `i` is equal to ")", increment `left` by 1
   - Else, break the loop
2. Loop through each character `i` in string `s` starting from index `left` to `n-1`:
   - If `i` is equal to "(", increment `right1` by 1
   - Else if `right1` is greater than 0, decrement `right1` by 1
   - Else, increment `left1` by 1
3. Add `left` to `left1`
4. For each iteration from 0 to `right1-1`, append ")" to string `s`
5. For each iteration from 0 to `left1-1`, prepend "(" to string `s`

Output operations:
- Print string `s`

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies: None
