Function Signature: count_segments(N: int, S: str) -> int

Variable Declarations:
N: int
S: str
x: int

Logic Flow:
1. Read integer N from input
2. Read string S from input
3. Initialize x to 1
4. For i from 0 to N-2:
    a. If character at index i in S is not equal to character at index i+1 in S:
        i. Increment x by 1
5. Print x

Control Structures:
- For loop with range from 0 to N-2
- If statement with condition S[i] != S[i+1]

Input/Output Operations:
- Read integer N from standard input
- Read string S from standard input
- Print integer x to standard output

Data Processing Logic:
- Count segments in string S where segments are defined by consecutive identical characters

Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- No specific libraries or modules required
