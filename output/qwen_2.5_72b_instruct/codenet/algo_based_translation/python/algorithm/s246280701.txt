Function signature:
- main()

Variable declarations:
- n: integer
- x: list of integers
- ans: integer
- i: integer
- tmp: list of integers
- j: integer

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read integer n from input
2. Read a line of space-separated integers from input, convert to list of integers x
3. Initialize ans to 10^10
4. For i from 0 to 100 (inclusive):
    a. Initialize tmp as a list of integers, where each element is (i - x[j])^2 for j from 0 to n-1 (inclusive)
    b. If sum of tmp is less than ans:
        i. Update ans to sum of tmp
5. Print ans

Control structures:
- For loop with condition i from 0 to 100 (inclusive)
- If statement with condition sum(tmp) < ans

Input/output operations:
- Read integer n from input
- Read space-separated integers from input, convert to list x
- Print integer ans

Data processing logic:
- Calculate the squared difference between each element in x and i
- Sum the squared differences
- Track the minimum sum of squared differences

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- None
