Function Signature: `process_input() -> None`

Variable Declarations:
- `A: int`
- `B: int`

Logic Flow:
1. Read a line of input and split it by spaces.
2. Convert each split string into an integer and assign the first to `A` and the second to `B`.
3. Check if `A` is less than 10 and `B` is less than 10:
   - If true, multiply `A` and `B`, and print the result.
   - Otherwise, print `-1`.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: A single line of two space-separated integers.
- Output: A single integer, which is the product of `A` and `B` if both are less than 10, otherwise `-1`.

Required Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules are required.
