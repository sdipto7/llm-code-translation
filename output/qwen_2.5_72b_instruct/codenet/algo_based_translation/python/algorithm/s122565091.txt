Function Signature: `main()`

Variable Declarations:
- `a: int`
- `v: int`
- `b: int`
- `w: int`
- `t: int`

Logic Flow:
1. Read input values for `a` and `v` as integers.
2. Read input values for `b` and `w` as integers.
3. Read input value for `t` as an integer.
4. If `a` is equal to `b`:
   - Print 'YES'
5. Else if `v` is less than or equal to `w`:
   - Print 'NO'
6. Else:
   - If `t` is less than the absolute difference between `a` and `b` divided by the difference between `v` and `w`:
     - Print 'NO'
   - Else:
     - Print 'YES'

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Three lines of integers.
- Output: A single string either 'YES' or 'NO'.

Data Processing Logic:
- Compare `a` and `b` for equality.
- Compare `v` and `w` to determine relative speeds.
- Calculate the time required for the faster entity to catch up to the slower one and compare it to `t`.

Required Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- None
