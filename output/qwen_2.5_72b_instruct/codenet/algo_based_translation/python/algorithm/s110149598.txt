Function signature: compare_and_print(a: str, b: str) -> None

Variable declarations and data types:
a: str
b: str

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read input as a single string and split it into two parts, assigning the first part to variable 'a' and the second part to variable 'b'.
2. Compare string 'a' with string 'b':
   - If 'a' is lexicographically less than 'b', print "<".
   - Else if 'a' is lexicographically greater than 'b', print ">".
   - Otherwise, print "=".

Control structures:
- Conditional statements:
  - if a < b:
  - elif a > b:
  - else:

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Reads a single line of input, splits it into two strings based on whitespace, and assigns them to 'a' and 'b'.
- Output: Prints one of the following strings based on comparison: "<", ">", or "=".

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
