Function Signature: main() -> None

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
a: int
b: int
c: int

Logic Flow:
1. Read input as a single line of three space-separated integers.
2. Map the input strings to integers using map function.
3. Unpack the mapped integers into variables a, b, c.
4. Check if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to c.
5. If true, print "Yes".
6. If false, print "No".

Control Structures:
Conditional: if a + b >= c then print "Yes" else print "No"

Input/Output Operations:
Input: Read from standard input (stdin)
Output: Print to standard output (stdout)

Data Processing Logic:
Sum calculation of variables a and b.
Comparison of the sum with variable c.

Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
No external libraries or modules are required.
