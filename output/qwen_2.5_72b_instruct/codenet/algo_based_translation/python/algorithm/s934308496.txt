Function Signature:
- main() -> None

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- n: int
- x: int
- m: list[int]

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. Read two integers n and x from input
2. Initialize list m with n integers read from input
3. Sort the list m in ascending order
4. Calculate sum of all elements in m
5. Compute the result as n plus integer division of (x minus sum of m) by the first element of m
6. Print the result

Control Structures:
- for loop: iterates n times to read integers into list m

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input: Two space-separated integers followed by n integers, each on a new line
- Output: A single integer representing the calculated result

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required
