Function Signature: main() -> None

Variable Declarations:
a: int
b: int

Logic Flow:
1. Import sys module
2. Read a line from standard input and split it into two integers, assign them to variables a and b
3. If a is greater than or equal to 13:
   - Print the value of b
4. Else if a is greater than or equal to 6:
   - Print the integer division of b by 2
5. Else:
   - Print 0

Control Structures:
- If condition: a >= 13
- Else if condition: a >= 6
- Else condition: (implied, no explicit condition)

Input/Output Operations:
- Read input from standard input
- Print to standard output

Data Processing Logic:
- Split input string into two integers
- Compare the first integer (a) with 13 and 6 to determine which value to print or calculate

Required Libraries:
- sys
