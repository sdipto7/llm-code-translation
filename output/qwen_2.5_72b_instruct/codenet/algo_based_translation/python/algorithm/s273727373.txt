Function Signature: 
- Function Name: main
- Parameters: None
- Return Type: None

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- N: Integer
- A: List of Integers
- B: List of Integers
- count: Integer

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to N.
2. Read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and assign the list to A.
3. Create a copy of list A and assign it to B.
4. Initialize count with 1.
5. Loop through each element i in list A:
   a. Assign the value of count to the element at index i-1 in list B.
   b. Increment count by 1.
6. Print all elements of list B, separated by spaces.

Control Structures:
- Loop: For loop with condition "for i in A"
- No conditionals

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input: Read an integer N and a space-separated list of integers A from the user.
- Output: Print the modified list B with elements separated by spaces.
- Data Processing: Replaces elements in list B based on the values in list A.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required.
