Function signature: `main()`  
Parameters: None  
Return type: None  

Variable declarations and data types:  
- `N`: integer  
- `A`: list of integers  
- `B`: list of integers initialized with 0s, length N  
- `tmp_sum`: integer  
- `i`, `j`: integers  

Logic flow in execution order:  
- Read integer `N` from input  
- Read list `A` of integers from input, split by spaces  
- Initialize list `B` with zeros, length `N`  
- For `i` from `N-1` to `0` inclusive (decrementing):  
    - Set `tmp_sum` to 0  
    - For `j` from `(i+1)*2-1` to `N` exclusive, incrementing by `i+1`:  
        - Add `B[j]` to `tmp_sum`  
        - Update `tmp_sum` to `tmp_sum % 2`  
    - Update `B[i]` to `tmp_sum ^ A[i]`  
- Print sum of elements in `B`  
- Create list of indices where `B[i]` is 1, increment each index by 1  
- Print elements of the created list, separated by spaces  

Input/output operations and data processing logic:  
- Read integer `N` from standard input  
- Read space-separated integers from standard input, convert to list `A`  
- Compute list `B` based on nested loop logic involving bitwise XOR and modulo operations  
- Output sum of elements in `B` to standard output  
- Output 1-based indices of elements in `B` that are 1, separated by spaces
