- Function signature: `main()`
- Variable declarations: 
  - `N: str`
  - `XS: List[int]`
  - `m: int`
  - `i: int`
  - `c: int`
- Libraries: `math`
- Execution order and logic flow:
  - Read input string `N`
  - Read input string, split by spaces, convert each to integer, store in list `XS`
  - Initialize `m` to 9999999999
  - For `i` from 1 to 100 (inclusive):
    - Calculate `c` as the sum of squared differences between each element `x` in `XS` and `i`
    - If `m` is greater than `c`, update `m` to `c`
  - Print the value of `m`
