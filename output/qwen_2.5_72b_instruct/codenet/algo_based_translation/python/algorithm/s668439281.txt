Function: main()

Parameters: None

Return Type: None

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- n: int
- ls: list of str
- c: Counter (from collections module)
- count: int
- ans: list of str
- p: list of tuples (str, int)

Logic Flow and Control Structures:

1. Read integer input from user and assign to n
2. Initialize empty list ls
3. For loop runs from 0 to n-1:
   - Read string input from user and append to ls
4. Create Counter object c from ls
5. Assign count to the frequency of the most common element in c using c.most_common()[0][1]
6. Initialize empty list ans
7. Assign p to the list of elements and their counts from c in descending order of frequency using c.most_common()
8. For loop runs from 0 to length of c:
   - If the count at index i in p is equal to count:
     - Append the element at index i in p to ans
   - Else:
     - Break out of loop
9. Sort ans in ascending order
10. For loop iterates over each element i in ans:
    - Print i

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input: Integer n followed by n strings
- Output: Strings that have the highest frequency in the input list, sorted alphabetically

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- collections module for Counter class
