Function Signature:
- `main() -> None`

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `n: int`
- `F: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int]]`
- `P: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int]]`
- `ans: int`
- `i: int`
- `tmp: int`
- `lst: List[int]`
- `j: int`
- `k: int`

Logic Flow:
1. Read integer `n` from input.
2. Initialize list `F` with `n` tuples of 10 integers each, read from input.
3. Initialize list `P` with `n` tuples of 10 integers each, read from input.
4. Set `ans` to -10^18.
5. For `i` from 1 to 2^10 - 1:
   1. Set `tmp` to 0.
   2. Initialize list `lst` with `n` zeros.
   3. For `j` from 0 to 9:
      1. If the `j`-th bit of `i` is 1:
         1. For `k` from 0 to `n` - 1:
            1. Increment `lst[k]` by `F[k][j]`.
   4. For `k` from 0 to `n` - 1:
      1. Increment `tmp` by `P[k][lst[k]]`.
   5. Set `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `tmp`.
6. Print `ans`.

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Read `n` as an integer from input.
- For each of the next `n` lines, read a tuple of 10 integers and store in list `F`.
- For each of the next `n` lines, read a tuple of 10 integers and store in list `P`.
- Iterate over all possible subsets of 10 time slots, represented by integers from 1 to 2^10 - 1.
- For each subset, calculate the total points based on the facility usage and the corresponding points matrix.
- Track the maximum points found.
- Print the maximum points.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- `None` (uses only built-in Python functionality)
