Function Signature:
- Function Name: find_closest_number
- Parameters: None
- Return Type: int

Variable Declarations:
- X: int
- N: int
- p: List[int]
- candidates: Dict[int, List[int]]
- i: int
- smallest: int
- minNum: int

Logic Flow:
1. Read two integers X and N from standard input, separated by a space.
2. Read a list p of N integers from standard input.
3. Sort the list p in ascending order.
4. Initialize an empty dictionary candidates where keys are integers and values are lists of integers.
5. Loop over the range from -1 to 101 (inclusive):
   a. If the current value i is in the list p, skip to the next iteration.
   b. If the absolute difference between X and i is not a key in candidates, add it as a key with a value of a list containing i.
   c. Otherwise, append i to the list that is the value of the key abs(X-i) in candidates.
6. Find the smallest key in candidates and assign it to smallest.
7. Find the minimum value in the list that is the value of the key smallest in candidates and assign it to minNum.
8. Print the value of minNum.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Two integers X and N followed by N integers representing the list p.
- Output: A single integer representing the closest number to X not in p.

Data Processing Logic:
- The algorithm first sorts the list p.
- It then iterates over a predefined range of numbers from -1 to 101.
- For each number i in this range, if i is not in p, it calculates the absolute difference between X and i.
- It groups these numbers by their absolute differences from X in the dictionary candidates.
- Finally, it selects the smallest absolute difference and from the numbers associated with this difference, it selects and prints the smallest number.

Required Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- No specific libraries or modules are required beyond the standard Python library.
