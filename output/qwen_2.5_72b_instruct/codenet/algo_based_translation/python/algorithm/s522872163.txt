Function signature: `main() -> None`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `X: int`
- `A: int`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read input values and split them into two parts.
2. Convert the split string values to integers and assign them to variables `X` and `A`.
3. Check if `X` is less than `A`.
   - If true, print `0`.
   - Otherwise, print `10`.

Control structures:
- Conditional: `if X < A`

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read a single line of input containing two space-separated integers.
- Output: Print either `0` or `10` based on the comparison of `X` and `A`.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules required.
