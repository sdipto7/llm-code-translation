Function Signature:
- solver() -> None

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- N: int
- action: List[List[int]]
- dp: List[List[int]]

Logic Flow:
1. Read integer N from input.
2. Initialize empty list action.
3. For i from 0 to N-1:
   - Read a line of input, split it into integers, convert to list, and append to action.
4. Initialize 2D list dp with dimensions N x 3, filled with 0s.
5. For i from 0 to 2:
   - Set dp[0][i] to action[0][i].
6. For i from 1 to N-1:
   - Set dp[i][0] to the maximum of (dp[i-1][1] + action[i][0]) and (dp[i-1][2] + action[i][0]).
   - Set dp[i][1] to the maximum of (dp[i-1][0] + action[i][1]) and (dp[i-1][2] + action[i][1]).
   - Set dp[i][2] to the maximum of (dp[i-1][0] + action[i][2]) and (dp[i-1][1] + action[i][2]).
7. Print the maximum value in dp[N-1].

Input/Output Operations:
- Read integer N from input.
- For each of the next N lines, read a line of input, split it into integers, and store in action.
- Print the maximum value in the last row of dp.

Data Processing Logic:
- Initialize the dp table with the first row of action.
- For each subsequent row in action, compute the maximum possible value for each column based on the values from the previous row and the corresponding values in action.
- After processing all rows, determine the maximum value in the last row of dp and print it.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules are required.
