Function Signature:
- main() -> None

Variable Declarations:
- n: int

Logic Flow:
1. Prompt user for input and read an integer value.
2. Assign the read integer value to variable n.
3. Compute the cube of n (n raised to the power of 3).
4. Print the result of the cube computation.

Control Structures:
- No control structures (loops, conditionals) are present.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read an integer from the user.
- Output: Print the cube of the input integer.

Data Processing Logic:
- Convert the input string to an integer.
- Calculate the cube of the integer using the exponentiation operator (**).
- Output the result.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No additional libraries, modules, or dependencies are required.
