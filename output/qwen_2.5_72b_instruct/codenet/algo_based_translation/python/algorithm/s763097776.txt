Function: main()
Parameters: None
Return Type: None

Variable Declarations:
n: integer
p: list of integers
p_copy: list of integers
count: integer

Logic Flow:
1. Read integer value from input and assign it to n
2. Read space-separated string values from input, convert each to integer, and store them in list p
3. Create a copy of list p and assign it to p_copy
4. Sort list p in ascending order
5. Initialize count to 0
6. Loop through indices from 0 to n-1:
   a. If element at current index in sorted list p is not equal to element at the same index in original list p_copy:
      i. Increment count by 1
7. If count is equal to 0 or count is equal to 2:
   a. Print "YES"
8. Otherwise:
   a. Print "NO"

Input Operations:
- Read integer value for n
- Read space-separated string values and convert them to integers for list p

Output Operations:
- Print "YES" or "NO" based on the value of count

Data Processing Logic:
- Copying list p to p_copy
- Sorting list p
- Comparing elements in p and p_copy to count mismatches

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules required
