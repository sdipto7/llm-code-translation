Function signature: main() -> None

Variable declarations:
- n: int
- res: float
- x: str
- u: str

Logic flow:
1. Read an integer input and assign it to n
2. Initialize res to 0.0
3. For _ in range(n):
   a. Read a line of input, split it into two parts, and assign the first part to x and the second part to u
   b. If u is equal to "BTC":
      i. Convert x to float, multiply it by 380000, and add the result to res
   c. Else:
      i. Convert x to int and add it to res
4. Print the value of res
