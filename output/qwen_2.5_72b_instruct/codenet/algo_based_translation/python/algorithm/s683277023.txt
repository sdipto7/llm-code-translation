Function Signature:
- `main() -> None`

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `n: int`
- `k: int`
- `li: list[int]`
- `tmp: list[int]`

Logic Flow:
1. Read two integers `n` and `k` from standard input, separated by whitespace.
2. Read a list of `n` integers from standard input, separated by whitespace, and store them in `li`.
3. Sort the list `li` in ascending order.
4. Create a sublist `tmp` containing the first `k` elements of `li`.
5. Calculate the sum of all elements in `tmp`.
6. Print the sum to standard output.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Two integers `n` and `k` on the first line, followed by `n` integers on the second line.
- Output: A single integer representing the sum of the smallest `k` integers from the input list.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules required.

Control Structures:
- No explicit loops or conditional statements present in the provided code. Sorting and sublist creation are implicit operations.
