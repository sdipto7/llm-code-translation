Function signature: main() -> None

Variable declarations and data types:
- ABC: List[int]
- A: int
- B: int
- C: int

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read a line of input from the user and split it by spaces.
2. Convert each split string element to an integer and store them in the list ABC.
3. Assign the first element of ABC to A.
4. Assign the second element of ABC to B.
5. Assign the third element of ABC to C.
6. Create a list containing three integers: 10*A + B + C, 10*B + C + A, 10*C + A + B.
7. Find the maximum value in the created list.
8. Print the maximum value.

Control structures:
- No loops or conditionals are present in the code.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: A single line of space-separated integers.
- Output: The maximum value among the three formed numbers.
- Data processing involves arithmetic operations to form the three different numbers and comparison to find the maximum.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules are required.
