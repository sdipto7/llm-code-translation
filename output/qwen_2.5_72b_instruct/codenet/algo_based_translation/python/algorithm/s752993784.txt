Function Signature: main()
Parameter Types: None
Return Type: None

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
s: List[int]
mods: List[int]
countRemainder: List[int]
cnt: int
m: int
mod: int
i: int

Logic Flow:
1. Convert input string to list of integers and assign to s
2. Initialize mods as list of zeros with length equal to s
3. Initialize countRemainder as list of zeros with length 2019
4. Initialize cnt to 0
5. Initialize m to 1
6. Initialize mod to 0

Loop 1 (for i in range(len(s))):
    a. Update mod by adding (integer value of character at position len(s) - i - 1 in s) multiplied by m
    b. Update mod to mod modulo 2019
    c. Update m by multiplying m by 10
    d. Update m to m modulo 2019
    e. Increment countRemainder[mod] by 1

7. Increment countRemainder[0] by 1

Loop 2 (for i in range(2019)):
    a. Update cnt by adding integer division of countRemainder[i] multiplied by (countRemainder[i] - 1) by 2

8. Print cnt

Input/Output Operations:
- Read input string from standard input
- Print final value of cnt to standard output

Data Processing Logic:
- Calculate remainders of partial sums of input digits when divided by 2019
- Count occurrences of each remainder
- Use combination formula to calculate number of pairs of positions with the same remainder

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required
