- Function signature: main() -> None
- Variable declarations: 
  - N: int
  - A: List[int]
  - ans: int
  - diff: List[int]
- Logic flow:
  - Input N as integer
  - Input a list of N integers into A
  - Initialize ans as absolute value of the last element of A
  - Prepend and append 0 to A
  - Initialize diff as a list of N zeros
  - For i from 1 to N (inclusive):
    - Calculate dif as absolute difference between A[i] and A[i-1] plus absolute difference between A[i] and A[i+1] minus absolute difference between A[i-1] and A[i+1]
    - Add absolute difference between A[i] and A[i-1] to ans
    - Assign dif to diff[i-1]
  - For i from 0 to N-1 (inclusive):
    - Print ans minus diff[i]
