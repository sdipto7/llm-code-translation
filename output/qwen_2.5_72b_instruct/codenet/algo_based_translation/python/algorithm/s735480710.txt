- Function signatures with parameter and return types:
  - `main() -> None`

- Variable declarations and data types:
  - `n: int`
  - `a: List[str]`
  - `b: List[str]`

- Complete logic flow in execution order:
  1. Read integer `n` from input.
  2. Read a line of input, split it by spaces, and convert each element to string, storing the result in list `a`.
  3. Initialize an empty list `b`.
  4. Slice list `a` to get elements at odd indices, reverse the sliced list, and concatenate it with elements at even indices from `a`, storing the result in `b`.
  5. Check if the length of `a` is even.
     - If true, join elements of `b` with spaces and print the result.
     - If false, reverse list `b`, join the elements with spaces, and print the result.

- Control structures (loops, conditionals) with exact conditions:
  - Conditional: `if len(a) % 2 == 0`

- Input/output operations and data processing logic:
  - Input: Read an integer `n` and a list of strings `a`.
  - Output: Print a space-separated string based on the conditions specified.

- Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
  - `collections.deque` (not used in the logic, but imported in the original code)
