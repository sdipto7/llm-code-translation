Function Signature: main() -> None

Variable Declarations:
- n: int
- x: List[int]

Logic Flow:
1. Read an integer from standard input and assign it to n.
2. Read a line from standard input, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and store the resulting list in x.
3. Reverse the list x in-place.
4. Print all elements of x separated by spaces.

Control Structures:
- No explicit loops or conditionals.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Two lines from standard input. First line is an integer n. Second line contains n space-separated integers.
- Output: A single line containing the integers from the second input line in reverse order, separated by spaces.

Data Processing Logic:
- Convert the second input line into a list of integers.
- Reverse the list.
- Join the reversed list into a string with space separators and print it.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No additional libraries, modules, or dependencies required. Uses built-in functions and data types.
