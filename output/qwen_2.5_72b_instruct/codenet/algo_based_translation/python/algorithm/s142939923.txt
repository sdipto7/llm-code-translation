Function Signature: `perform_operations(a: int, b: int) -> int`

Variable Declarations:
- `a: int`
- `b: int`
- `x: List[int]`

Logic Flow:
1. Read two integers from input, assign to `a` and `b`
2. Calculate the sum of `a` and `b`, append result to list `x`
3. Calculate the difference of `a` and `b`, append result to list `x`
4. Calculate the product of `a` and `b`, append result to list `x`
5. Find the maximum value in list `x`
6. Print the maximum value

Control Structures:
- No loops or conditionals present

Input/Output Operations:
- Read space-separated integers from input
- Print the maximum result from operations

Data Processing Logic:
- Perform arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication
- Store results in list
- Determine and return the maximum result

Required Libraries/Modules:
- `sys` (implied by input function)
