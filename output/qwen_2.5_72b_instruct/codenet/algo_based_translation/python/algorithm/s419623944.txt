Function Signature: `process_numbers(N: int, R: int) -> None`

Variable Declarations:
- `N: int`
- `R: int`

Logic Flow:
1. Read input and split into two integers, assign to `N` and `R`
2. If `N` is greater than or equal to 10:
   - Print `R`
3. Else:
   - Calculate `R + 100 * (10 - N)`
   - Print the result

Control Structures:
- If-Else Condition: `if N >= 10`

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read a line of input, split into two integers
- Output: Print an integer

Data Processing Logic:
- Compare `N` with 10
- Depending on the comparison, either print `R` or calculate and print `R + 100 * (10 - N)`

Required Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- None
