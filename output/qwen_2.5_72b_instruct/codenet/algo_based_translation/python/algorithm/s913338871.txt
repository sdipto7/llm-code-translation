Function signature: `main()` with no parameters and no return type

Variable declarations:
- `N` of type integer
- `a` of type list of integers
- `s` of type list of integers

Algorithm logic:
- Read an integer `N` from the input
- Read a line of space-separated integers, convert each to an integer, and store in list `a`
- Sort list `a` in ascending order
- Create list `s` by taking every second element from list `a` starting from index `N`
- Calculate the sum of all elements in list `s`
- Print the sum

Input/output operations:
- Read input values for `N` and `a` from standard input
- Print the sum of selected elements to standard output

Data processing logic:
- Sorting of list `a`
- Slicing of list `a` to create `s`
- Summation of elements in `s`

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required
