Function signature: main()

Variable declarations and data types:
- s: string
- q: integer
- qs: list of lists of strings
- n: boolean
- left: string
- right: string
- operation: list of strings
- t: string
- f: integer
- c: string

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Read a string input and assign it to s
2. Read an integer input and assign it to q
3. Initialize an empty list qs
4. For i in range q do:
   - Read a line of input, split it by spaces, and append the resulting list to qs
5. Set n to False
6. Set left to an empty string
7. Set right to an empty string
8. For each operation in qs do:
   - If the first element of operation is '1' then:
     - Toggle the value of n
   - If the first element of operation is '2' then:
     - Assign the elements of operation to t, f, and c respectively
     - Convert f to integer
     - If n is True then:
       - Set f to 1 if f is not equal to 1, otherwise set f to 2
     - If f is equal to 1 then:
       - Prepend c to left
     - Else if f is equal to 2 then:
       - Append c to right
9. Concatenate left, s, and right, and assign the result back to s
10. If n is True then:
    - Print the reverse of s
    - Otherwise, print s

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Read a string input
- Read an integer q
- Read q lines of input and process each line based on the operation type ('1' or '2')
- Modify the strings left and right based on the operation type and parameters
- Concatenate the strings left, s, and right
- Print the final string, possibly reversed

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- None
