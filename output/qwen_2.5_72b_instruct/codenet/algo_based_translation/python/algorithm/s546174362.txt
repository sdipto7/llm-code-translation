Function: main
Parameters: None
Return Type: None

Variable Declarations:
N: Integer
M: Integer
A: List of Integers

Logic Flow:
1. Read two integers from input, assign to N and M
2. Read N integers from input, assign to list A
3. Sort list A in ascending order

While M is greater than 0:
    1. Divide the last element of A by 2 and update the last element
    2. Decrement M by 1
    3. Initialize i to -2
    4. While M is greater than 0 and i is greater than or equal to -N and the i-th element from the end of A is greater than or equal to the last element of A:
        1. Divide the i-th element from the end of A by 2 and update the i-th element
        2. Decrement M by 1
        3. Decrement i by 1
    5. Sort list A in ascending order

Print the sum of all elements in A

Input/Output Operations:
- Read two space-separated integers from input
- Read N space-separated integers from input
- Print a single integer (sum of all elements in A)

Data Processing Logic:
- Perform integer division on elements of A
- Sort the list A after each modification
- Maintain a count M to limit the number of operations

Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- No specific libraries or modules required
