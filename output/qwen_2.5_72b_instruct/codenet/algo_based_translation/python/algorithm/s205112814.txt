Function Signature: main() -> None

Variable Declarations:
- n: int
- m: int
- gate_cond: List[List[int]]
- max_under_th: int
- min_upper_th: int

Logic Flow:
1. Read two integers n and m from input, separated by space.
2. Initialize gate_cond as an empty list.
3. For _ in range(m):
   - Read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each element to int, and append the resulting list to gate_cond.
4. Initialize max_under_th as the maximum of the first element of each list in gate_cond.
5. Initialize min_upper_th as the minimum of the second element of each list in gate_cond.
6. If min_upper_th - max_under_th >= 0:
   - Print min_upper_th - max_under_th + 1.
7. Else:
   - Print 0.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Two integers n and m on the first line, followed by m lines each containing two integers.
- Output: A single integer representing the number of integers that satisfy all given conditions or 0 if no such integers exist.

Data Processing Logic:
- Parse input to obtain the number of conditions (m) and the conditions themselves.
- Determine the maximum lower threshold (max_under_th) and the minimum upper threshold (min_upper_th) from the conditions.
- Calculate the number of integers that lie within all given thresholds.
- Output the result based on the comparison of max_under_th and min_upper_th.

Required Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- No specific libraries or modules are required. The code uses built-in Python functions and data structures.
