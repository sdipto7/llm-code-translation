Function signature: `main()`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `A, B, C, X, Y` as integers
- `ans` as integer
- `k` as integer
- `total` as integer

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read input values for `A, B, C, X, Y` as integers from the standard input.
2. Initialize `ans` to 10^10.
3. For each integer `k` from 0 to `max(X, Y)` (inclusive):
   - Calculate `total` as `2 * C * k + A * max(0, X - k) + B * max(0, Y - k)`.
   - If `total` is less than `ans`, update `ans` to `total`.
4. Print the value of `ans`.

Control structures:
- For loop: `for k in range(max(X, Y) + 1)`
- Conditional statement: `if total < ans`

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read five integers from the standard input.
- Output: Print the minimum calculated `total` value.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- None
