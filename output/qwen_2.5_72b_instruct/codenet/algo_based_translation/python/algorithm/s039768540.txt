Function Signature:
- Function Name: main
- Parameters: None
- Return Type: None

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- x: Integer

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to variable x.
2. Calculate the integer division of x by 100.
3. Repeat the string "3" the number of times equal to the result of the integer division in step 2.
4. Concatenate the string "ai1333" with the result of step 3.
5. Print the concatenated string.

Control Structures:
- No explicit loops or conditionals.

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input: Read an integer from the user.
- Output: Print a string that starts with "ai1333" followed by a number of "3" characters determined by the integer division of the input by 100.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required.
