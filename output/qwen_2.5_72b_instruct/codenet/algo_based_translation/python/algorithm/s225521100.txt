Function signature: `main()`
Variable declarations and data types: 
- `N`: integer
- `K`: integer
- `A`: list of integers
- `d`: integer
- `AA`: list of integers
- `n`: integer
Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Read integers `N` and `K` from standard input.
2. Initialize list `A` with `N` elements, all set to 0.
3. For `i` from 0 to `K-1`:
   a. Read integer `d` from standard input.
   b. Read list `AA` of `d` integers from standard input.
   c. For `j` from 0 to `d-1`:
      i. Set element at index `AA[j] - 1` in list `A` to 1.
4. Initialize integer `n` to 0.
5. For `i` from 0 to `N-1`:
   a. If element at index `i` in list `A` is 0:
      i. Increment `n` by 1.
6. Print integer `n` to standard output.
Control structures:
- For loop: `for i in range(N)`
- For loop: `for i in range(K)`
- For loop: `for j in range(d)`
- If conditional: `if A[i] == 0`
Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Two integers `N` and `K`, followed by `K` pairs of an integer `d` and a list of `d` integers.
- Output: Single integer representing count of elements in list `A` that are still 0 after processing.
Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No libraries or modules required.
