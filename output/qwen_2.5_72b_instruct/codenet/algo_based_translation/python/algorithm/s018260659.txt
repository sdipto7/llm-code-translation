Function Signature: check_nine_divisibility(N: int) -> None

Variable Declarations:
- N: int
- cnt: int

Logic Flow:
1. Read an integer input and assign it to N
2. Initialize cnt to 1
3. While cnt is less than or equal to 9:
   a. If N modulo cnt is 0 and N divided by cnt is between 1 and 9 inclusive:
      i. Print 'Yes'
      ii. Break the loop
   b. Else:
      i. Increment cnt by 1
4. If the loop completes without printing 'Yes':
   a. Print 'No'

Control Structures:
- While loop with condition cnt <= 9
- If-else statement with conditions N % cnt == 0 and 1 <= N / cnt <= 9

Input/Output Operations:
- Read integer input
- Print 'Yes' or 'No' based on the conditions

Data Processing Logic:
- Check if N is divisible by any number from 1 to 9 and if the quotient is also between 1 and 9

Required Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- None
