Function signature: main() -> None

Variable declarations:
- q: int
- h: int
- s: int
- d: int
- n: int
- min_1: int
- min_2: int

Logic flow:
1. Read four integers q, h, s, d from input, separated by spaces.
2. Read integer n from input.
3. Calculate min_1 as the minimum value among q*4, h*2, q*2+h, and s.
4. Calculate min_2 as the minimum value between min_1*2 and d.
5. Print the result of the expression (n % 2)*min_1 + (n // 2)*min_2.

Input/output operations:
- Input: Two lines of integers. The first line contains four integers q, h, s, d. The second line contains one integer n.
- Output: A single integer representing the calculated result.

Control structures:
- No loops or conditionals present in the code.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules required.
