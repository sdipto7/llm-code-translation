Function signature: `main() -> None`

Variable declarations:
- `a: int`
- `b: int`

Logic flow:
1. Read a line of input from the user.
2. Split the input line into two parts.
3. Convert each part into an integer and assign them to `a` and `b` respectively.
4. Check if `a` is divisible by 3.
   - If true, print 'Possible' and exit.
5. Check if `b` is divisible by 3.
   - If true, print 'Possible' and exit.
6. Check if the sum of `a` and `b` is divisible by 3.
   - If true, print 'Possible' and exit.
7. If none of the above conditions are met, print 'Impossible'.

Control structures:
- Conditional (if) with conditions `a % 3 == 0`, `b % 3 == 0`, and `(a + b) % 3 == 0`.

Input/output operations:
- Input: Read a line of input from the user.
- Output: Print 'Possible' or 'Impossible' based on the conditions.

Data processing logic:
- Convert input strings to integers.
- Perform modulus operations to check divisibility by 3.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- None
