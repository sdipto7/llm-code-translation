Function Signature: `calculate_y(X: int) -> int`

Variable Declarations:
- `X: int`
- `h: int`
- `a: int`
- `y: int`

Logic Flow:
- Input: Read an integer `X` from the user
- Calculation: 
  - Compute `h` as integer division of `X` by 500
  - Compute `a` as integer division of the remainder of `X` divided by 500 by 5
  - Compute `y` as `h` multiplied by 1000 plus `a` multiplied by 5
- Output: Print the value of `y`

Control Structures:
- No loops or conditionals present

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: `X = int(input())`
- Output: `print(y)`

Data Processing Logic:
- Arithmetic operations: division, multiplication, addition, modulus

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules required
