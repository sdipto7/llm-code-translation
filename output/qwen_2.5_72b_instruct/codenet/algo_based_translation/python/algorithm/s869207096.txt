Function Signature:
- function_name: count_segments
- parameters: s (str)
- return_type: int

Variable Declarations:
- n (int)
- s (str)
- cnt (int)

Logic Flow:
1. Read an integer n from the input
2. Read a string s from the input
3. Initialize cnt to 1
4. For i from 0 to n-2 do:
   - If s[i] is equal to s[i+1] then continue to the next iteration
   - Else increment cnt by 1
5. Print the value of cnt

Control Structures:
- For loop with range from 0 to n-2
- If-Else conditional statement with condition s[i] == s[i+1]

Input/Output Operations:
- Read integer n from input
- Read string s from input
- Print the integer value of cnt

Data Processing Logic:
- Count the number of segments in the string s where a segment is defined as a contiguous run of the same character

Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules required
