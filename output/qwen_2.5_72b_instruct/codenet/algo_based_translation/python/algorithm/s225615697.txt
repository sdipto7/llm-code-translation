Algorithm:
Function signatures:
- main() -> None

Variable declarations and data types:
- n: int
- a: List[int]
- m1: int
- result: str
- m: List[Optional[int]]

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read an integer n from input
2. Read a list of integers a of length n from input
3. Calculate m1 as the integer division of the sum of the product of each element in a and (-1) raised to the power of the index of the element, all divided by 2
4. Convert m1 to string and assign to result
5. Initialize a list m of length n with None values
6. Assign m1 to the first element of m
7. For i from 1 to n-1:
   - Assign the difference between the element at index i-1 of a and the element at index i-1 of m to the element at index i of m
8. Print the space-separated string of each element in m multiplied by 2

Control structures:
- For loop with range from 1 to n-1

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Read n and a from input
- Print the processed list m as space-separated string

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- None
