Function signatures with parameter and return types:
- `main(): None`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `N: int`
- `A: List[int]`
- `ans: int`

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Read an integer `N` from input.
2. Read a space-separated string of integers from input, convert it to a list of integers `A`.
3. Sort the list `A` in non-decreasing order.
4. Calculate the difference between the last element and the first element of the sorted list `A` and store it in `ans`.
5. Print the value of `ans`.

Control structures:
- No loops or conditionals are present in the provided code.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read an integer `N` and a list of integers `A` from standard input.
- Output: Print the integer `ans`, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `A`.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- `typing.List` for type annotation of list `A`. However, since this is not imported or used directly in the code, it is not strictly required for the code to run.
