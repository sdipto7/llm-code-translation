Function Signature:
- `main() -> None`

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `a: int`
- `b: int`

Logic Flow in Execution Order:
1. Read a line of input from the standard input.
2. Split the input line by spaces.
3. Convert the split strings to integers and assign them to `a` and `b`.
4. If `a` is equal to `b`, compute the sum of `a` and `b`.
5. Otherwise, compute `max(a, b) * 2 - 1`.
6. Print the result of either step 4 or step 5.

Control Structures:
- Conditional (if-else):
  - Condition: `a == b`
  - If true: Execute `a + b`
  - If false: Execute `max(a, b) * 2 - 1`

Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
- Input: Read a single line of input containing two space-separated integers.
- Output: Print a single integer which is either the sum of `a` and `b` if they are equal, or `max(a, b) * 2 - 1` if they are not equal.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules are required.
