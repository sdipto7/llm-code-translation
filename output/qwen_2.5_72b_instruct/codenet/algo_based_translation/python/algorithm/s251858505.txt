Function signature: `main()` with no parameters and no return type

Variable declarations:
- `input1`: string, result of `input()`
- `input2`: string, result of `input()`
- `mapped_values`: map object, result of `map(lambda x, y: x == y, input1, input2)`
- `sum_result`: integer, result of `sum(mapped_values)`

Logic flow:
1. `input1` is assigned the result of `input()`
2. `input2` is assigned the result of `input()`
3. `mapped_values` is assigned the result of `map` applying the lambda function `(lambda x, y: x == y)` to each pair of characters from `input1` and `input2`
4. `sum_result` is assigned the result of `sum(mapped_values)`
5. `sum_result` is printed

Control structures:
- No explicit loops or conditionals, but the `map` function implicitly iterates over the characters in `input1` and `input2`
- The lambda function contains a comparison condition `x == y`

Input/output operations:
- `input()` is called twice to read strings `input1` and `input2`
- `print(sum_result)` outputs the final count of matching characters

Data processing logic:
- The lambda function checks if characters `x` and `y` are equal, returning `True` (1) if they are and `False` (0) otherwise
- `sum(mapped_values)` counts the number of `True` values, which corresponds to the number of matching characters between `input1` and `input2`

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules are required
