Function Signature: 
- main() -> None

Variable Declarations:
- A: int
- B: int
- min: int
- max: int
- ans: int
- i: int

Logic Flow:
1. Read two space-separated integers from input and assign them to A and B respectively.
2. Calculate min as B multiplied by 10.
3. Calculate max as (B + 1) multiplied by 10 then subtract 1.
4. Initialize ans to -1.
5. For each integer i from min to max inclusive:
   a. If the integer part of i multiplied by 0.08 equals A:
      i. Set ans to i.
      ii. Break out of the loop.
6. Print the value of ans.
