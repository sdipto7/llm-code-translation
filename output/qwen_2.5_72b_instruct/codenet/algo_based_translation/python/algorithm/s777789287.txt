Function: main()
Parameters: None
Return Type: None

Variable Declarations:
- n: Integer
- m: Integer
- a: List of Integers
- s: Float

Algorithm:
1. Input: Read a line of input, split it into two integers, and assign them to n and m
2. Input: Read a line of input, split it into a list of integers, assign to a, and sort a in descending order
3. Compute: Calculate the sum of all elements in a, divide by 4*m, and assign the result to s
4. Conditional:
   - If a[m-1] is greater than or equal to s, then:
     - Output: Print "Yes"
   - Else:
     - Output: Print "No"
