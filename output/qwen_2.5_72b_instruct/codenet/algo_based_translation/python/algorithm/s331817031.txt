Function Signature:
- main() -> None

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- h: int
- w: int
- l: List[List[str]]
- tmp: int
- i: int
- j: int
- a: List[str]

Logic Flow:
1. Read two integers h and w from input, representing height and width.
2. Initialize an empty list l to store the grid.
3. For each of the h lines, read a string, convert it to a list of characters, and append it to l.
4. Initialize tmp to 0.
5. For each row index i from 0 to h-1:
   - For each column index j from 0 to w-1:
     - If the character at l[i][j] is '#':
       - If j is less than tmp, print "Impossible" and exit the program.
       - Otherwise, set tmp to j.
6. If no "Impossible" condition is met, print "Possible".

Control Structures:
- For loop: Iterates over range(h) with index i.
- For loop nested inside the first: Iterates over range(w) with index j.
- If condition: Checks if l[i][j] is '#'.
- If condition nested inside the previous: Checks if j is less than tmp.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Reads two integers h and w. Reads h lines of strings.
- Output: Prints "Impossible" or "Possible" based on the conditions.

Data Processing Logic:
- Constructs a 2D list l from the input strings.
- Checks each '#' character's column index against the current maximum column index stored in tmp.
- If any '#' is found in a column index less than the current maximum, it prints "Impossible".
- If all '#' characters are in non-decreasing column indices, it prints "Possible".

Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
- No specific libraries or modules are required. Uses built-in Python functions and types.
