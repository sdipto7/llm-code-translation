Function Signature: `main() -> None`

Variable Declarations:
- `s: str`
- `i: int`
- `c: str`
- `s1: str`
- `j: int`

Logic Flow:
1. Input: Read a string `s` from the user.
2. Check if the length of `s` is less than 26:
   1. Loop over integers `i` from 0 to 25:
      1. Generate character `c` as the `i`-th alphabet character.
      2. Check if `c` is not in `s`:
         1. Output: Print `s` concatenated with `c`.
         2. Exit the program.
3. Else:
   1. Loop over integers `i` from 25 to 1 in reverse:
      1. Check if the character at position `i-1` in `s` is less than the character at position `i` in `s`:
         1. Set `s1` to the substring of `s` from the start to position `i-2`.
         2. Loop over integers `j` from 0 to 25:
            1. Generate character `c` as the `j`-th alphabet character.
            2. Check if `c` is greater than the character at position `i-1` in `s` and `c` is not in `s1`:
               1. Output: Print `s1` concatenated with `c`.
               2. Exit the program.
   2. Output: Print `-1`.

Input/Output:
- Input: Read a single string `s`.
- Output: Print a single string or `-1`.

Data Processing:
- String manipulation and comparison.
- Character generation using ASCII values.

Libraries/Modules/Dependencies: None
