Function signature: `determine_suffix()`
Parameter and return types: Takes no parameters, returns nothing (void)

Variable declarations and data types:
- `n`: integer

Complete logic flow in execution order:
1. Read input from the user as a string
2. Convert the last character of the input string to an integer and assign it to `n`
3. Check if `n` is equal to 2, 4, 5, 7, or 9
   - If true, print "hon"
4. Otherwise, check if `n` is equal to 0, 1, 6, or 8
   - If true, print "pon"
5. If none of the above conditions are met, print "bon"

Control structures:
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) with exact conditions:
  - `if n == 2 or n == 4 or n == 5 or n == 7 or n == 9`
  - `elif n == 0 or n == 1 or n == 6 or n == 8`
  - `else`

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read a string from the user
- Processing: Extract the last character of the string, convert it to an integer, and determine which suffix to print based on its value
- Output: Print one of the strings "hon", "pon", or "bon" based on the value of `n`
