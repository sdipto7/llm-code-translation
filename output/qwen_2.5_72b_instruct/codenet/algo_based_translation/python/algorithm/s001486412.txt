Function signature: `calculate_harmonic_mean(n: int, a: List[int]) -> float`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `n: int`
- `a: List[int]`
- `below: float`

Logic flow in execution order:
1. Read an integer `n` from the input.
2. Read a list of integers `a` from the input, splitting by spaces.
3. Initialize `below` to 0.0.
4. For each element `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`:
   1. Increment `below` by `1 / a[i]`.
5. Print `1 / below`.

Control structures:
- For loop iterating from 0 to `n-1`.

Input/output operations and data processing logic:
- Input: Read an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
- Output: Print the harmonic mean calculated as `1 / below`.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- No additional libraries or modules required.
