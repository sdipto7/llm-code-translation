**Structured Algorithm Specification:**

**Function Signature:**
```python
def calculate_matches(s: str, t: str) -> tuple[int, int]
```

**Variables:**
- `freqs: dict[str, int]` (character frequency map for string `s`)
- `freqt: dict[str, int]` (character frequency map for string `t`)
- `yay: int` (count of exact case-sensitive matches)
- `whoops: int` (count of case-insensitive matches after exhausting exact matches)

**Logic Flow:**

1. **Input Acquisition:**
   - Read input strings `s` and `t` from standard input.

2. **Frequency Map Initialization:**
   - Initialize `freqs` by iterating through each character in `s`:
     - Increment count for existing entries
     - Create new entry with count=1 for new characters
   - Initialize `freqt` by iterating through each character in `t` using same logic as `freqs`.

3. **Exact Match Calculation (yay):**
   - For each character `c` in `freqs.keys()`:
     - While `freqs[c] > 0` AND `c` exists in `freqt` AND `freqt[c] > 0`:
       - Increment `yay` by 1
       - Decrement `freqs[c]` by 1
       - Decrement `freqt[c]` by 1

4. **Case-Insensitive Match Calculation (whoops):**
   - For each character `c` in `freqs.keys()`:
     - While `freqs[c] > 0`:
       - If `c` is lowercase:
         - Check if `c.upper()` exists in `freqt` AND `freqt[c.upper()] > 0`
         - If true:
           - Increment `whoops` by 1
           - Decrement `freqs[c]` by 1
           - Decrement `freqt[c.upper()]` by 1
         - Else: exit loop
       - Else if `c` is uppercase:
         - Check if `c.lower()` exists in `freqt` AND `freqt[c.lower()] > 0`
         - If true:
           - Increment `whoops` by 1
           - Decrement `freqs[c]` by 1
           - Decrement `freqt[c.lower()]` by 1
         - Else: exit loop
       - Else: exit loop

5. **Result Output:**
   - Return tuple `(yay, whoops)` as final result

**Control Flow Structures:**
- Nested loops:
  - 2 `for` loops for frequency map initialization
  - 2 sequential `for` loops for match calculations
  - `while` loops within character iterations for multi-occurrence processing
- Conditional branches:
  - `if`/`else` in frequency map initialization
  - Compound condition checks in `yay` calculation loop
  - Case-checking conditionals with character case validation in `whoops` calculation

**Edge Case Handling:**
- Explicit existence checks (`c in freqt`) before accessing dictionary entries
- Case transformation validation (`.islower()`/`.isupper()`) before case conversions
- Loop exit on first failed match attempt in case-insensitive processing

**Data Flow:**
- Input strings → frequency maps → incremental match counters → aggregated result tuple
- Frequency maps are mutated during processing to track remaining character counts

**Dependencies:**
- Standard library functions:
  - `str.islower()`
  - `str.isupper()`
  - `str.lower()`
  - `str.upper()`
- No external libraries required
