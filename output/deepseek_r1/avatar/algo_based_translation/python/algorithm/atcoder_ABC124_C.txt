**Structured Algorithm Specification:**

**Function/Method Signatures:**
- Procedure `main()`
  - Input: None (reads from standard input)
  - Output: Integer (writes to standard output)

**Variables:**
- `s`: List of characters (string converted to list)
- `even`: Dictionary (Counter) with keys as characters (str), values as integer counts
- `odd`: Dictionary (Counter) with keys as characters (str), values as integer counts

**Input Operations:**
1. Read input string from standard input, convert to list of characters `s`.

**Data Processing:**
2. Create `even` by counting occurrences of each character in `s[0::2]` (even indices).
3. Create `odd` by counting occurrences of each character in `s[1::2]` (odd indices).

**Logic Flow:**
4. Calculate `flips_0_start`:
   - Total flips = length of `s` - (`even["0"]` + `odd["1"]`)
5. Calculate `flips_1_start`:
   - Total flips = length of `s` - (`even["1"]` + `odd["0"]`)
6. Compute `result` as minimum of `flips_0_start` and `flips_1_start`.

**Output Operations:**
7. Print `result` as integer to standard output.

**Control Structures:**
- Linear execution flow with no explicit loops or conditionals (implicit iteration via Counter construction).

**Edge Case Handling:**
- Implicitly handles empty input (returns 0 when `len(s) == 0`).
- Defaults missing Counter keys to 0 via dictionary-like access.

**External Dependencies:**
- Requires a Counter/dictionary data structure for frequency counting.
- Implicit dependency on list slicing and string/list conversion operations.
