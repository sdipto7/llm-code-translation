```structured_algorithm
Function: solve_case()
Parameters: None
Return Type: void

Variables:
- n: int
- m: int
- count: int[][]
- ans: int (initialized to -1)
- x: int
- y: int
- found: bool
- k: int
- i: int
- j: int

Algorithm:
1. Read n and m from standard input via split() method.
2. Initialize count as 2D array of size n x n with all elements set to 0.
3. Set ans = -1.
4. For k from 0 to m-1:
    a. Read x and y from standard input via split() method.
    b. Decrement x by 1.
    c. Decrement y by 1.
    d. Set found = false.
    e. For i from (x - 2) to x (inclusive):
        i. If i >= 0 AND i < n:
            For j from (y - 2) to y (inclusive):
                a. If j >= 0 AND j < n:
                    i. Increment count[i][j] by 1.
                    ii. If count[i][j] == 9:
                        Set found = true.
    f. If found == true:
        i. Set ans = (k + 1).
        ii. Break loop over k.
5. Print ans to standard output.

Edge Case Handling:
- Automatically skips invalid indices through boundary checks (i >= 0, i < n, j >= 0, j < n)
- Returns -1 if no 3x3 subgrid reaches cumulative count 9 after m operations

Input Processing:
- Reads integers from stdin using split() and map(int, ...)
- Converts x,y from 1-based to 0-based indexing

Control Flow:
- Nested for-loops for 3x3 grid checks with early termination via break
- Loop over m operations with early exit when solution found
