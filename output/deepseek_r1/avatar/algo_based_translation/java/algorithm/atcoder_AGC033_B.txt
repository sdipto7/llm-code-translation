**Algorithm:**

1. **Input Parameters:**
   - Integers: h (grid height), w (grid width), n (number of moves), sr (start row), sc (start column)
   - Strings: s (sequence of moves), t (opponent's response sequence)

2. **Variables:**
   - Boolean: end (flag for early termination)
   - Integers: usafe (upper safe row), dsafe (lower safe row), lsafe (left safe column), rsafe (right safe column)

3. **Vertical Safety Calculation:**
   - Initialize usafe = 1, dsafe = h
   - For i from n-1 downto 0:
     - If s[i] == 'U': increment usafe
     - Else if s[i] == 'D': decrement dsafe
     - If usafe > dsafe: set end = true, break loop
     - If i > 0 and t[i-1] == 'U': increment dsafe (capped at h)
     - Else if i > 0 and t[i-1] == 'D': decrement usafe (capped at 1)

4. **Horizontal Safety Calculation:**
   - Initialize lsafe = 1, rsafe = w
   - For i from n-1 downto 0:
     - If s[i] == 'L': increment lsafe
     - Else if s[i] == 'R': decrement rsafe
     - If lsafe > rsafe: set end = true, break loop
     - If i > 0 and t[i-1] == 'L': increment rsafe (capped at w)
     - Else if i > 0 and t[i-1] == 'R': decrement lsafe (capped at 1)

5. **Final Check:**
   - If sr is within [usafe, dsafe] AND sc is within [lsafe, rsafe] AND end is false: Output "YES"
   - Else: Output "NO"

6. **I/O Operations:**
   - Read h, w, n, sr, sc, s, t from standard input
   - Write "YES" or "NO" to standard output

7. **Control Structures:**
   - Two nested loops iterating from n-1 to 0 (reverse order)
   - Conditional branches based on character comparisons ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R')
   - Conditional checks for safety range validity (usafe <= dsafe, lsafe <= rsafe)
   - Early termination with break on invalid ranges
   - Clamping operations during opponent response handling

8. **Data Types:**
   - All coordinates and counts as integers (32-bit)
   - Strings s and t (1-based index access via charAt)
   - Boolean flag for termination

**Dependencies:**
- Java Standard Library: Scanner for input, System for output
- No external modules required
