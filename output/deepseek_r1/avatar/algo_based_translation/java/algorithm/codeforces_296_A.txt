```
function main():
    input:
        - n: integer from standard input
        - n subsequent integers as elements
    variables:
        - frequency: array[1001] of integers initialized to 0
        - countMax: integer initialized to -1
        - element: integer for temporary storage

    process:
        for i from 0 to n-1:
            read element from input
            increment frequency[element] by 1

        for i from 1 to 1000:
            if frequency[i] > countMax:
                set countMax = frequency[i]

        if n is even:
            if countMax <= n/2:
                print "YES"
            else:
                print "NO"
        else:
            if countMax <= (n//2) + 1:
                print "YES"
            else:
                print "NO"

required components:
    - Input handling equivalent to Java's BufferedReader and StringTokenizer
    - Integer parsing
    - Console output capability

data flow:
    1. Read input values and count frequencies
    2. Determine maximum frequency
    3. Validate frequency distribution against n's parity
    4. Output YES/NO based on majority condition

control structures:
    - For loop with fixed iterations (n times and 1000 times)
    - Conditional branches with:
        - Comparison operators (>, <=, ==)
        - Arithmetic operations (division, modulo)
        - Nested if-else statements

boundary conditions:
    - First array index used: 1 (elements are positive integers)
    - Handles n=0 through frequency array initialization
    - Odd/even division handled via integer arithmetic
```
