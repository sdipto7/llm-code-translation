```algorithm
Function Signature:
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException

Libraries/Dependencies:
- java.io.IOException
- java.time.LocalTime
- java.util.*

Variables:
- Scanner sc: initialized with System.in
- String[] s: stores first input split by ":"
- String[] t: stores second input split by ":"
- LocalTime x: constructed from parsed hours and minutes of s
- LocalTime y: constructed from parsed hours and minutes of t

Execution Steps:
1. Read input line, split into s using ":" delimiter
2. Read input line, split into t using ":" delimiter
3. Parse s[0] as integer (hours) and s[1] as integer (minutes)
4. Create x using parsed hours and minutes from s
5. Parse t[0] as integer (hours) and t[1] as integer (minutes)
6. Create y using parsed hours and minutes from t
7. Subtract y's hours from x using x.minusHours(y.getHour())
8. Subtract y's minutes from result using .minusMinutes(y.getMinute())
9. Print final LocalTime result via System.out.println

Control Structures:
- Sequential execution only. No loops or conditionals present.

Input/Output:
- Input: Two time strings in HH:mm format via standard input
- Processing: Parse times, calculate time difference via subtraction
- Output: Resulting LocalTime in default ISO-8601 format (HH:mm:ss.SSS)
```
