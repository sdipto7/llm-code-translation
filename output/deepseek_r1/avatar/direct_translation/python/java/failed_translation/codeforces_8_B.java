To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given sequence of movements results in a collision or a potential bug. The movements are given as a string of characters, each representing a direction ('L', 'R', 'U', 'D'). The goal is to check if the path taken by the object either revisits a previous position (collision) or if there's a potential bug where a new position is adjacent to another position that is not the previous one.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**: Start at the origin (0, 0) and use a map to track the direction vectors for each movement.
2. **Track Positions**: Use a map to keep track of all visited positions.
3. **Check Movements**: For each movement in the input string:
   - Calculate the new position based on the current direction.
   - Check if the new position has been visited before. If yes, a collision is detected.
   - If the new position is not visited, check if any adjacent positions (except the previous position) have been visited. If so, a potential bug is detected.
4. **Output Result**: After processing all movements, output "BUG" if a collision or potential bug is detected, otherwise output "OK".

### Solution Code

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class codeforces_8_B {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String recordOfMovement = scanner.nextLine();
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        Map<Character, int[]> dMovement = new HashMap<>();
        dMovement.put('L', new int[]{0, -1});
        dMovement.put('R', new int[]{0, 1});
        dMovement.put('U', new int[]{1, 0});
        dMovement.put('D', new int[]{-1, 0});
        Map<String, String> d = new HashMap<>();
        d.put("0,0", "");
        boolean bug = false;

        for (char move : recordOfMovement.toCharArray()) {
            int tempX = x;
            int tempY = y;
            int[] moveDir = dMovement.get(move);
            x += moveDir[0];
            y += moveDir[1];
            String newPos = x + "," + y;

            if (!d.containsKey(newPos)) {
                boolean found = false;
                for (char dir : dMovement.keySet()) {
                    int[] dirArr = dMovement.get(dir);
                    int checkX = x + dirArr[0];
                    int checkY = y + dirArr[1];
                    String checkPos = checkX + "," + checkY;
                    if (checkX != tempX || checkY != tempY) {
                        if (d.containsKey(checkPos)) {
                            found = true;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }
                if (found) {
                    bug = true;
                    break;
                }
            } else {
                bug = true;
                break;
            }

            d.put(newPos, "");
        }

        System.out.println(bug ? "BUG" : "OK");
    }
}


### Explanation
- **Direction Mapping**: The `dMovement` map translates each direction character into a coordinate change vector.
- **Position Tracking**: The `d` map keeps track of all visited positions using string keys of the form "x,y".
- **Collision Check**: For each new position, we check if it has been visited before. If it has, a collision is detected.
- **Adjacency Check**: If the new position is not visited, we check all adjacent positions (excluding the previous position) to see if any have been visited. If so, a potential bug is detected.
- **Result**: The result is determined based on whether a collision or potential bug was detected during the movement sequence.
