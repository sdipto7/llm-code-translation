To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of iterations required for a "hole" to reach or exceed a given size `b` based on a specific growth formula. The hole starts at size 1 and grows according to the formula `a * (i + 1) - i` where `i` is the iteration count. 

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: Start with the hole size initialized to 1 and the iteration count `i` set to 0.
2. **Loop Until Condition Met**: Use a loop to repeatedly update the hole size using the given formula until the hole size is at least `b`.
3. **Update Formula**: In each iteration, update the hole size using the formula `a * (i + 1) - i` and increment the iteration count.
4. **Termination**: Exit the loop once the hole size meets or exceeds `b` and print the iteration count.

### Solution Code

import java.util.Scanner;

public class atcoder_ABC139_B {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int hole = 1;
        int i = 0;
        boolean check = true;
        while (check) {
            if (hole >= b) {
                check = false;
            } else {
                hole = a * (i + 1) - i;
                i++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}


### Explanation
- **Input Handling**: The code reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input.
- **Initialization**: The hole starts at size 1, and the iteration count `i` starts at 0.
- **Loop Execution**: The loop continues until the hole size is at least `b`. In each iteration, the hole size is updated using the formula `a * (i + 1) - i`, and `i` is incremented.
- **Termination**: Once the hole size meets or exceeds `b`, the loop exits, and the final value of `i` (the number of iterations) is printed.

This approach efficiently computes the required iterations using a straightforward loop and arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance for the problem constraints.
