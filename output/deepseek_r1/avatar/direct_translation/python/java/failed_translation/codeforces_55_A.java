To translate the Python code into Java, we need to handle input differently and use Java's syntax. The logic remains the same: repeatedly divide the number by 2 while it's even, then check if the result is 1. 

The Java code uses `Scanner` for input, converts the input to an integer, and follows the same loop and conditional structure as the Python code. The division in Java using `n /= 2` works similarly for integers. Finally, it prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result.
