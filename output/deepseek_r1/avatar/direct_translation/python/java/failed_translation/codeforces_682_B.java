To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of elements in a sorted list that can be considered "good" based on a specific condition. The condition is that an element is considered good if it is greater than the count of previously considered good elements. 

### Approach
1. **Input Reading and Parsing**: Read the input values and convert them into an integer array.
2. **Sorting**: Sort the array to process elements in ascending order. This helps in efficiently determining the count of good elements by leveraging the sorted order.
3. **Counting Good Elements**: Iterate through the sorted array and maintain a counter. For each element, if it is greater than the current count of good elements, increment the counter. This ensures that each element considered as good meets the condition of being greater than the number of previously counted good elements.
4. **Output the Result**: The result is the count of good elements plus one, as the problem's specific condition requires adjusting the final count.

### Solution Code

import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class codeforces_682_B {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
        String[] input = br.readLine().split(" ");
        int[] l = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            l[i] = Integer.parseInt(input[i]);
        }
        Arrays.sort(l);
        int c = 0;
        for (int i : l) {
            if (i > c) {
                c++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(c + 1);
    }
}


### Explanation
1. **Input Handling**: The input is read using a `BufferedReader` for efficient reading. The first line gives the number of elements, and the second line contains the elements themselves.
2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to process elements in ascending order, which simplifies the counting process.
3. **Counting Logic**: By iterating through the sorted array, we check each element against the current count of good elements. If the element is greater than the current count, it is considered good, and the count is incremented. This ensures that each subsequent element is checked against the updated count, maintaining the problem's condition.
4. **Result Adjustment**: The final result is the count of good elements plus one, which is printed as the output. This adjustment is necessary based on the problem's specific requirement to determine the maximum possible number of good elements.
