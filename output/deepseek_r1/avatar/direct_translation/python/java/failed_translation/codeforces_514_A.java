To solve this problem, we need to transform a given number based on specific rules. The transformation involves checking each digit of the number and modifying it if it meets certain conditions. The goal is to produce the smallest possible number after applying these transformations.

### Approach
1. **Input Handling**: Read the input number as a string to handle each digit individually.
2. **Special Case Handling**: If the input number starts with '9', we keep the first digit as '9' and process the remaining digits.
3. **Digit Transformation**: For each digit in the number:
   - If the digit is greater than 4, replace it with the difference between 9 and the digit.
   - If the digit is 4 or less, keep it unchanged.
4. **Output**: Convert the transformed string back to an integer to remove any leading zeros and print the result.

### Solution Code

import java.util.Scanner;

public class codeforces_514_A {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String ip = scanner.nextLine();
        StringBuilder st = new StringBuilder();
        
        if (ip.length() != 1) {
            if (ip.startsWith("9")) {
                st.append("9");
                ip = ip.substring(1);
            }
            for (char c : ip.toCharArray()) {
                int num = Character.getNumericValue(c);
                if (num > 4) {
                    int n = 9 - num;
                    st.append(n);
                } else {
                    st.append(c);
                }
            }
        } else {
            st.append(ip);
        }
        
        System.out.println(Integer.parseInt(st.toString()));
    }
}


### Explanation
- **Input Handling**: The input is read as a string to process each digit individually.
- **Special Case Handling**: If the input starts with '9', we retain this digit to avoid leading zeros in the transformed number.
- **Digit Transformation**: Each digit is checked, and if it is greater than 4, it is replaced by 9 minus the digit. This ensures the smallest possible number after transformation.
- **Output Conversion**: The transformed string is converted to an integer to remove any leading zeros that might have been introduced during the transformation process, ensuring the smallest valid number is printed.

This approach efficiently processes each digit in linear time, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.
