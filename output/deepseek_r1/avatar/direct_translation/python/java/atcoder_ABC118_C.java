To solve this problem, we need to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of integers. The GCD of multiple numbers is the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder. 

### Approach
1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of integers and the integers themselves.
2. **GCD Calculation**: Compute the GCD of the list by iteratively applying the GCD function to pairs of numbers. Start with the first element and compute the GCD with the next element, then use the result to compute the GCD with the subsequent elements, and so on.
3. **Euclidean Algorithm**: Use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD of two numbers efficiently. This algorithm repeatedly replaces the larger number by its remainder when divided by the smaller number until one of the numbers becomes zero. The non-zero number at this point is the GCD.

### Solution Code

import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class atcoder_ABC118_C {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.nextLine();
        int[] A = Arrays.stream(scanner.nextLine().split(" ")).mapToInt(Integer::parseInt).toArray();
        int gcd = A[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < A.length; i++) {
            gcd = gcd(gcd, A[i]);
        }
        System.out.println(gcd);
    }

    private static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
}


### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read using a `Scanner` object. The first integer `N` is the number of elements, followed by the elements themselves which are read into an array `A`.
2. **Initial GCD**: The initial value of `gcd` is set to the first element of the array.
3. **Iterative GCD Calculation**: For each subsequent element in the array, the GCD of the current `gcd` value and the element is computed using the `gcd` method. This updates the `gcd` to be the GCD of all elements processed so far.
4. **Euclidean Algorithm**: The `gcd` method implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. This method efficiently reduces the problem size by using modulo operations until the remainder is zero, at which point the non-zero remainder is the GCD.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the GCD of the entire list with a time complexity of O(N log M), where N is the number of elements and M is the maximum value in the list.
