To solve this problem, we need to generate a string of length `n` where each character cycles through the characters in the string "abcd". The character at each position `i` in the generated string is determined by the index `i % 4` of the "abcd" string. 

### Approach
1. **Input Handling**: Read the integer `n` which determines the length of the output string.
2. **String Construction**: Use a loop to iterate from 0 to `n-1`. For each iteration, append the character from the "abcd" string at the position `i % 4` to a result string.
3. **Efficiency**: Use a `StringBuilder` to efficiently build the result string, as string concatenation in Java using `+` inside loops is inefficient due to the immutability of strings.

### Solution Code

public class codeforces_110_B {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String LUCKY = "abcd";
        int n = Integer.parseInt(System.console().readLine());
        StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            s.append(LUCKY.charAt(i % 4));
        }
        System.out.println(s.toString());
    }
}


### Explanation
- **Reading Input**: The input `n` is read using `System.console().readLine()` and converted to an integer.
- **StringBuilder**: A `StringBuilder` is used to efficiently construct the result string. This avoids the overhead of creating new string objects in each iteration of the loop.
- **Looping and Character Selection**: For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the character at position `i % 4` of the "abcd" string is appended to the result. The modulus operation ensures that the index cycles through 0, 1, 2, 3 repeatedly.
- **Output**: The constructed string is printed as the final output.

This approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem requirements.
