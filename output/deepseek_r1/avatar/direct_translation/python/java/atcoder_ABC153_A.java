To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce a given integer `h` to zero by repeatedly subtracting another integer `a`. The solution should be efficient and handle edge cases where `h` is not perfectly divisible by `a`.

### Approach
1. **Input Handling**: Read the input values `h` and `a` from the user.
2. **Initial Calculation**: Compute the quotient `sho` by dividing `h` by `a`. This gives the number of times `a` can be subtracted from `h` without considering the remainder.
3. **Check Remainder**: Calculate the remainder `am` when `h` is divided by `a`. If the remainder is not zero, it means one additional operation is needed to reduce the remaining value to zero.
4. **Adjust Quotient**: Increment the quotient by 1 if there is a non-zero remainder.
5. **Output Result**: Print the final value of the quotient, which represents the minimum number of operations required.

### Solution Code

import java.util.Scanner;

public class atcoder_ABC153_A {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String[] input = scanner.nextLine().split(" ");
        int h = Integer.parseInt(input[0]);
        int a = Integer.parseInt(input[1]);
        int sho = h / a;
        int am = h % a;
        if (am != 0) {
            sho++;
        }
        System.out.println(sho);
    }
}


### Explanation
- **Input Handling**: The input is read as a single line and split into two integers `h` and `a`.
- **Initial Calculation**: The integer division `h / a` gives the number of times `a` can be subtracted from `h` completely.
- **Check Remainder**: The modulus operation `h % a` checks if there is any remainder left after the division. If there is a remainder, it means one more operation is needed to cover the remaining value.
- **Adjust Quotient**: Incrementing the quotient by 1 when there's a remainder ensures that all parts of `h` are accounted for.
- **Output**: The final result is printed, which is the minimum number of operations required.

This approach efficiently handles both cases where `h` is perfectly divisible by `a` and where it is not, ensuring the correct result with minimal computational steps.
