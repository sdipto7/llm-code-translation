To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit that can be achieved by selecting the optimal combination of time slots for shops to be open. Each shop has specific time slots when it is open, and the profit depends on the number of overlapping time slots selected.

### Approach
1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of shops and their respective open time slots (F array) and profit values (P array).
2. **Bitmasking**: Use bitmasking to generate all possible combinations of time slots (from 1 to 2^10 - 1). Each bit in the bitmask represents whether a specific time slot is selected.
3. **Count Overlaps**: For each bitmask, calculate the number of overlapping time slots for each shop.
4. **Calculate Profit**: Using the overlaps, compute the profit for each shop and sum them up.
5. **Maximize Profit: Track the maximum profit across all possible combinations of time slots.

### Solution Code

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class s906994739 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
        int[][] F = new int[n][10];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String[] parts = br.readLine().split(" ");
            for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
                F[i][j] = Integer.parseInt(parts[j]);
            }
        }
        int[][] P = new int[n][11];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String[] parts = br.readLine().split(" ");
            for (int j = 0; j < 11; j++) {
                P[i][j] = Integer.parseInt(parts[j]);
            }
        }
        long ans = -1000000000000000000L;
        for (int i = 1; i < (1 << 10); i++) {
            int[] lst = new int[n];
            for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
                if ((i & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                        lst[k] += F[k][j];
                    }
                }
            }
            long tmp = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                tmp += P[k][lst[k]];
            }
            if (tmp > ans) {
                ans = tmp;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}


### Explanation
1. **Input Reading**: The input is read using a `BufferedReader` for efficiency. The number of shops `n` is read first, followed by the `F` array (shop open times) and `P` array (profit values).
2. **Bitmasking Loop**: The loop runs from 1 to 2^10 - 1, generating all possible combinations of time slots using bitmasking.
3. **Overlap Calculation**: For each bitmask, the number of overlapping time slots for each shop is calculated by checking each bit in the bitmask and summing the corresponding values from the `F` array.
4. **Profit Calculation**: For each shop, the profit is determined based on the number of overlapping time slots using the `P` array. The total profit for the current bitmask is computed and compared to the maximum profit found so far.
5. **Result**: The maximum profit across all bitmask combinations is printed as the result.

This approach efficiently explores all possible time slot combinations using bitmasking and ensures that the optimal solution is found by evaluating each combination's profitability.
