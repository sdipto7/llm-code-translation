To solve this problem, we need to balance a string of parentheses by adding the minimum number of parentheses necessary. The goal is to ensure that the resulting string is valid, meaning every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')', and vice versa.

### Approach
1. **Identify Unmatched Closing Parentheses at the Start**: First, we count the number of consecutive closing parentheses at the beginning of the string. These will need to be matched by adding opening parentheses at the start of the string later.

2. **Count Unmatched Parentheses in the Remaining String**: For the remaining part of the string (after the initial closing parentheses), we track the balance of parentheses. We use a counter to keep track of the number of opening parentheses and adjust it as we encounter closing parentheses. If we encounter a closing parenthesis without a corresponding opening one, we count it as an unmatched closing parenthesis.

3. **Calculate Required Parentheses**: The total number of opening parentheses needed is the sum of the initial unmatched closing parentheses and any unmatched closing parentheses found in the remaining part of the string. The number of closing parentheses needed is determined by any remaining unmatched opening parentheses after processing the entire string.

4. **Construct the Balanced String**: Finally, we construct the balanced string by adding the necessary opening parentheses at the start and closing parentheses at the end.

### Solution Code

public class s952876397 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = Integer.parseInt(System.console().readLine());
        String s = System.console().readLine();

        int left = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == ')') {
                left++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }

        int left1 = 0;
        int right1 = 0;

        for (int i = left; i < n; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '(') {
                right1++;
            } else if (right1 > 0) {
                right1--;
            } else {
                left1++;
            }
        }

        left1 += left;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);
        for (int i = 0; i < right1; i++) {
            sb.append(')');
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < left1; i++) {
            sb.insert(0, '(');
        }

        System.out.println(sb.toString());
    }
}


### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the input values for the length of the string and the string itself.
2. **Initial Closing Parentheses**: The first loop counts the number of consecutive closing parentheses at the start of the string.
3. **Balance Check**: The second loop processes the remaining part of the string to count the balance of parentheses. It tracks how many opening parentheses are needed to balance the closing ones and vice versa.
4. **Constructing the Result**: Using a `StringBuilder`, the code appends the necessary closing parentheses at the end and inserts the required opening parentheses at the start to balance the string.

This approach ensures that the minimum number of parentheses are added to make the string valid, efficiently balancing both the start and end of the input string.
