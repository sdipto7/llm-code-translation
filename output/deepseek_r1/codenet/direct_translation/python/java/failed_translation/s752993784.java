To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of substrings of a given string of digits that form a number divisible by 2019. The approach involves leveraging properties of modular arithmetic to efficiently count such substrings without explicitly checking each possible substring.

### Approach
1. **Modular Arithmetic Insight**: A number is divisible by 2019 if its remainder when divided by 2019 is 0. For a substring from index i to j, the number formed can be expressed as (number from 0 to j) - (number from 0 to i-1) * 10^(j-i+1). Using modular arithmetic, this translates to checking if the difference in their remainders modulo 2019 is 0.

2. **Reverse Traversal**: Compute the remainder of the number formed from the end of the string to each position. This allows us to efficiently compute the required remainders using powers of 10 modulo 2019.

3. **Count Remainders**: Use an array to count how many times each remainder (0 to 2018) occurs. The number of valid substrings ending at each position can be determined by the count of previous remainders.

4. **Combination Calculation**: For each remainder value, the number of valid substrings is given by the combination formula C(n, 2) = n*(n-1)/2, where n is the count of that remainder.

### Solution Code

public class s752993784 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = new java.util.Scanner(System.in).next();
        int[] countRemainder = new int[2019];
        int cnt = 0;

        int m = 1;
        int currentMod = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            currentMod += (s.charAt(s.length() - 1 - i) - '0') * m;
            currentMod %= 2019;
            m = (m * 10) % 2019;
            countRemainder[currentMod]++;
        }
        countRemainder[0]++;

        for (int i = 0; i < 2019; i++) {
            cnt += countRemainder[i] * (countRemainder[i] - 1) / 2;
        }
        System.out.println(cnt);
    }
}


### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stored.
2. **Reverse Traversal and Remainder Calculation**: Starting from the end of the string, we compute the remainder of the number formed by each suffix substring. This is done using modular arithmetic to keep the numbers manageable.
3. **Updating Remainder Counts**: For each computed remainder, we increment its count in the `countRemainder` array.
4. **Combining Counts**: After processing all characters, we use the combination formula to count the number of valid substrings for each remainder and sum them up.
5. **Output Result**: The total count of valid substrings is printed.

This approach efficiently reduces the problem complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) by leveraging modular arithmetic and precomputing remainders, making it feasible for large input sizes.
