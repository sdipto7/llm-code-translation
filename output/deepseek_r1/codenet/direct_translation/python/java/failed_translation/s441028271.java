To solve this problem, we need to determine the output based on the parity of the integer `k`. The solution involves reading four integers from the input and then checking if `k` is even or odd to decide the result of a specific arithmetic operation.

### Approach
1. **Input Reading**: Read four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `k` from the input. Although `c` is not used in the calculation, it is part of the input and must be read to correctly parse the input sequence.
2. **Check Parity of `k`**: Determine if `k` is even or odd using the modulus operator (`%`).
3. **Compute Result**:
   - If `k` is even, compute the result as `a - b`.
   - If `k` is odd, compute the result as `b - a`.
4. **Output the Result**: Print the computed result based on the parity of `k`.

### Solution Code

import java.util.Scanner;

public class s441028271 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();
        int k = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(k % 2 == 0 ? a - b : b - a);
    }
}


### Explanation
- **Reading Input**: The code uses `Scanner` to read the four integers from the standard input.
- **Parity Check**: The ternary operator (`?:`) is used to check if `k` is even or odd. This operator simplifies the conditional check into a single line.
- **Output Calculation**: Depending on the result of the parity check, the appropriate arithmetic operation is performed and the result is printed immediately.

This approach efficiently handles the problem with a time complexity of O(1) since all operations are performed in constant time, and the space complexity is also O(1) as only a fixed number of integer variables are used.
