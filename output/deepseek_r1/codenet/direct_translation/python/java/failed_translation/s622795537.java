To solve this problem, we need to determine the most frequently occurring strings from a list of input strings and then output the first character of each of these most frequent strings in alphabetical order.

### Approach
1. **Read Input**: First, we read the number of strings and then each string itself.
2. **Count Frequencies**: Use a hash map to count the occurrences of each string.
3. **Find Maximum Frequency**: Determine the highest frequency of any string in the hash map.
4. **Collect First Characters**: Extract the first character of each string that has the maximum frequency.
5. **Sort and Output**: Sort these first characters alphabetically and print them.

### Solution Code

import java.util.*;

public class s622795537 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String s = scanner.nextLine();
            map.put(s, map.getOrDefault(s, 0) + 1);
        }

        int maxCount = Collections.max(map.values());
        ArrayList<Character> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() == maxCount) {
                list.add(entry.getKey().charAt(0));
            }
        }

        Collections.sort(list);
        for (char c : list) {
            System.out.println(c);
        }
    }
}


### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The number of strings `n` is read first. Each subsequent string is read and stored in a hash map where the key is the string and the value is its count.
2. **Counting Frequencies**: The `getOrDefault` method efficiently updates the count of each string.
3. **Finding Maximum Frequency**: Using `Collections.max`, we find the highest frequency of any string in the hash map.
4. **Extracting First Characters**: For each string with the maximum frequency, the first character is collected into a list.
5. **Sorting and Output**: The list of first characters is sorted alphabetically using `Collections.sort` and then each character is printed.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count frequencies, determine the maximum, and output the required characters in sorted order.
