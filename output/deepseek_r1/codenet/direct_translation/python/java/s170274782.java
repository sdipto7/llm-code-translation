To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points that can be obtained by switching from the first row to the second row at any possible position. The points are accumulated from the start of the first row up to the switch point and then from the switch point to the end of the second row.

### Approach
1. **Input Reading**: Read the input values, which include the number of columns (N) and the two rows of integers representing the points.
2. **Calculate Points for Each Switch Position**: For each possible switch position from the first row to the second row, compute the total points accumulated. This involves summing the points from the start of the first row up to the current position and then summing the points from the current position to the end of the second row.
3. **Determine Maximum Points**: After computing the points for all possible switch positions, find the maximum value among these computed points.

### Solution Code

import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class s170274782 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> A = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
            ArrayList<Integer> row = new ArrayList<>();
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                row.add(scanner.nextInt());
            }
            A.add(row);
        }
        
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            ArrayList<Integer> baselis = A.get(0);
            ArrayList<Integer> groundlis = A.get(1);
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                count += baselis.get(j);
            }
            for (int j = i; j < N; j++) {
                count += groundlis.get(j);
            }
            ans.add(count);
        }
        
        int max = ans.stream().max(Integer::compare).get();
        System.out.println(max);
    }
}


### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read using a `Scanner`. The first value is the number of columns (N), followed by two rows of integers.
2. **Storing Rows**: The two rows of integers are stored in an `ArrayList` of `ArrayList` for easy access.
3. **Calculating Points for Each Position**: For each possible switch position (from 0 to N-1), the points are calculated by summing the elements from the start of the first row up to the current position and from the current position to the end of the second row.
4. **Finding Maximum Points**: The maximum value from all calculated points is determined using the `max` method from the Java Stream API.

This approach efficiently computes the required maximum points by iterating through each possible switch position and calculating the sum in linear time for each position, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(N^2). However, given the constraints, this approach is efficient enough for typical problem constraints.
