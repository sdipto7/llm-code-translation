To solve this problem, we need to rearrange the elements of an array based on specific indexing and reversal rules. The goal is to generate a new array by taking elements from specific indices, reversing certain parts, and then combining them. The final output depends on whether the original array's length is even or odd.

### Approach
1. **Input Reading**: Read the input values, where the first value is the number of elements (which is not used in the processing) and the second line contains the array elements.
2. **Partitioning the Array**:
   - **First Part**: Extract elements starting from index 1 and every second element thereafter. Reverse this subset.
   - **Second Part**: Extract elements starting from index 0 and every second element thereafter.
3. **Combining Parts**: Concatenate the reversed first part with the second part.
4. **Final Adjustment**: If the original array's length is even, output the combined list as is. If odd, reverse the combined list before outputting.

### Solution Code

import java.util.*;

public class s735480710 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine());
        String[] a = sc.nextLine().split(" ");
        List<String> part1 = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i < a.length; i += 2) {
            part1.add(a[i]);
        }
        Collections.reverse(part1);
        List<String> part2 = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i += 2) {
            part2.add(a[i]);
        }
        List<String> combined = new ArrayList<>();
        combined.addAll(part1);
        combined.addAll(part2);
        if (a.length % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println(String.join(" ", combined));
        } else {
            Collections.reverse(combined);
            System.out.println(String.join(" ", combined));
        }
    }
}


### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read using a scanner. The first line (number of elements) is parsed but not used. The second line is split into an array of strings.
2. **Partitioning**:
   - **First Part**: Elements at indices 1, 3, 5, etc., are collected into a list and then reversed.
   - **Second Part**: Elements at indices 0, 2, 4, etc., are collected into another list.
3. **Combining**: The reversed first part is combined with the second part.
4. **Output Adjustment**: Depending on the original array's length (even or odd), the combined list is either printed directly or reversed before printing.

This approach ensures that the elements are rearranged according to the specified rules, efficiently handling both even and odd lengths of the input array.
