To solve this problem, we need to determine how many numbers from 1 to N are not present in any of the given lists. The solution involves reading the input data, collecting all the numbers that are present, and then calculating the difference between the total count (N) and the count of unique numbers present.

### Approach
1. **Read Input**: First, read the values of N (total numbers) and K (number of lists).
2. **Collect Numbers**: Use a set to collect all unique numbers from the given lists. This helps in efficiently checking and storing the presence of numbers.
3. **Calculate Result**: The result is the difference between N and the size of the set, which gives the count of numbers that are missing from all lists.

### Solution Code

import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Set;

public class s411244720 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int K = scanner.nextInt();
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < K; i++) {
            int d = scanner.nextInt();
            for (int j = 0; j < d; j++) {
                int num = scanner.nextInt();
                set.add(num);
            }
        }

        System.out.println(N - set.size());
    }
}


### Explanation
- **Reading Input**: The input is read using a `Scanner` object. The first two integers read are N and K.
- **Storing Numbers**: A `HashSet` is used to store the numbers encountered in all the lists. This data structure ensures that each number is stored only once, even if it appears in multiple lists.
- **Processing Each List**: For each of the K lists, the number of elements (d) is read first, followed by the elements themselves. Each element is added to the set.
- **Calculating Missing Numbers**: The result is computed by subtracting the size of the set (number of unique elements present) from N, which gives the count of numbers that are not present in any list.

This approach efficiently handles the input and ensures that the solution is optimal in terms of both time and space complexity.
