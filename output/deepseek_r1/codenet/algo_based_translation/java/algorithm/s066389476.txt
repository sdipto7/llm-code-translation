Algorithm Extraction:

1. Imports
   - Import java.util.Scanner

2. Function Signatures
   - public static void main(String[] args)
   - public static void solve(Scanner sc)

3. Variables
   - Scanner sc (parameter in solve method)
   - char[] a (initialized from sc.next().toCharArray())

4. Input Handling
   - Read input string via sc.next() and convert to char array

5. Logic Flow
   - Check if any two consecutive characters in positions 0-1, 1-2, or 0-2 are equal
   - Conditions:
     a[0] == a[1] (first and second character)
     a[1] == a[2] (second and third character)
     a[2] == a[0] (third and first character)

6. Control Structure
   - Single if-else conditional:
     if (any of the three equality conditions are true) 
         print "No"
     else 
         print "Yes"

7. Output Operations
   - System.out.println("No") when duplicates found
   - System.out.println("Yes") when all characters distinct

8. Assumptions
   - Input string has exactly 3 characters
   - Input is read before processing
   - Scanner is closed automatically via try-with-resources

9. Dependencies
   - Requires java.util.Scanner for input handling
   - No external libraries beyond standard Java SE
