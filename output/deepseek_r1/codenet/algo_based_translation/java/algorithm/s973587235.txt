# Algorithm Extraction

Function Signature:
- public static void main(String[] args) → void

Variables:
- Scanner sc (System.in)
- int n (first input)
- int minN (initialized as second input -1)
- int h (per iteration)
- int i (loop counter)

Input Operations:
1. Read integer n from standard input
2. Read integer x and set minN = x - 1

Processing Logic:
1. For i from 0 to (n - 2) inclusive:
   a. Read integer h from input
   b. Check:
      - If minN == h → set minN = h
      - Else if minN == h - 1 → set minN = h - 1
      - Else if minN < h - 1 → set minN = h - 1
      - Else if minN > h → print "No" and terminate program

Control Flow:
- Sequential execution with 1 loop iteration
- Four mutually exclusive condition checks per iteration:
  1. Equality check (minN == h)
  2. Adjacent value check (minN == h-1)
  3. Lower bound check (minN < h-1)
  4. Upper bound violation (minN > h)

Termination Conditions:
- Immediate termination if any minN > h case occurs
- Normal termination after loop completion

Output Operations:
- Print "No" and exit if violation detected
- Print "Yes" if all elements processed without violations

Required Dependencies:
- java.util.Scanner
