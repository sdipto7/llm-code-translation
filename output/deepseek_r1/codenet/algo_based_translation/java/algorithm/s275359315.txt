1. Required Dependencies:
   - java.util.Scanner

2. Function Signatures:
   - public static void main(String[] args)

3. Variables:
   - Scanner scan: Instance of Scanner initialized with System.in
   - int r: Stores integer input from user
   - int res: Stores squared value of r

4. Execution Flow:
   1. Create Scanner object for reading input
   2. Read integer from standard input using Scanner.nextInt() -> assign to r
   3. Calculate square of r using Math.pow() with 2 as exponent
   4. Explicitly cast result to int (double -> int)
   5. Print resulting integer to standard output using System.out.println()

5. Data Processing:
   Input -> Integer (r)
   Transformation: rÂ² through floating-point calculation with cast to integer
   Output: Integer result of squaring operation

6. Control Structures:
   - Linear execution flow with no loops or conditional blocks

7. I/O Operations:
   - Single integer input from console
   - Single integer output to console
