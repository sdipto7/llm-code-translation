1. Required library:
   - java.util.Scanner

2. Function signature:
   - main method: public static void main(String[] args)

3. Variable declarations:
   - Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)
   - int h = scanner.nextInt()
   - int a = scanner.nextInt()

4. Execution flow:
   a. Read integer input for h
   b. Read integer input for a
   c. Compare h modulus a with 0 using equality check
   d. If comparison is true:
      - Calculate h divided by a
      - Print result as integer
   e. If comparison is false:
      - Calculate (h divided by a) + 1
      - Print result as integer

5. Control structures:
   - Single if-else block:
     if (h % a == 0)
     else

6. Input operations:
   - Two consecutive nextInt() calls on Scanner instance

7. Output operations:
   - System.out.println() call with calculated value

8. Data processing:
   - Integer division
   - Modulus calculation
   - Arithmetic addition (only in else branch)
