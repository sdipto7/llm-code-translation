- Function: 
  - Name: main
  - Parameters: String[] args
  - Return: void

- Variables:
  - Scanner in
  - String c
  - Character letter

- Libraries/Dependencies: 
  - java.util.Scanner

- Logic Flow:
  1. Initialize Scanner with System.in
  2. Read next input token as String c
  3. Extract first character from c (charAt(0)) and store as Character letter
  4. Increment letter by 1 using ++ operator
  5. Print letter via System.out.println

- Control Structures: None beyond sequential execution

- Input/Output:
  - Input: Single character string from standard input
  - Output: Next Unicode character printed to standard output

- Data Processing:
  - Character increment operation handles ASCII/Unicode rollover automatically
