- Required libraries: java.util.Scanner

- Function signature:
  - public static void main(String[] args)

- Variables:
  - Scanner sc (java.util.Scanner)
  - String C (user input)

- Execution flow:
  1. Initialize Scanner with System.in
  2. Read entire next token from input as String C
  3. Extract first character from C using charAt(0)
  4. Convert character to ASCII value and increment by 1
  5. Cast result back to character type
  6. Print resulting character via System.out.println

- Input/Output:
  - Input: Single string from standard input
  - Output: Single character following input's first character in ASCII sequence

- Data processing:
  - Direct character arithmetic through ASCII value manipulation
  - No explicit error checking for empty input
