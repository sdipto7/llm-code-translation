- **Function Signature**: Script (no explicit function)
- **Variables**:
  - `n: int` (unused)
  - `m: int` (unused)
  - `x: int`
  - `a: list[int]`
  - `ans: int` (initialized to 0, unused)
  - `i: int`
- **Input Operations**:
  1. Read first input line: split into `n`, `m`, `x` as integers.
  2. Read second input line: split into list `a` as integers.
- **Libraries**: `bisect` module (imported).
- **Logic Flow**:
  1. Import `bisect`.
  2. Compute `i = bisect.bisect(a, x)` (insertion point for `x` in sorted list `a`).
  3. Split `a` into two sublists: `a[:i]` and `a[i:]`.
  4. Calculate lengths of both sublists.
  5. Find the minimum of the two lengths.
  6. Print the minimum value.
- **Assumptions**:
  - List `a` is pre-sorted (required for `bisect` to work correctly).
