- Input Operations:
  1. Read integer N from standard input
  2. Read two space-separated strings S and T from standard input

- Variable Declarations:
  - N: int
  - S: str
  - T: str
  - char_lists: List[str] (initialized as empty list)
  - i: int (loop index)
  - char: str (current character from S)

- Logic Flow:
  1. Initialize empty list char_lists
  2. Iterate through each character and its index in S:
     Loop: for i, char in enumerate(S)
     a. Append current character from S to char_lists
     b. Append character at index i from T to char_lists
  3. Concatenate all elements in char_lists into single string
  4. Print resulting string

- Output Operation:
  1. Print concatenated string using joined char_lists

- Control Structures:
  - Single for loop with enumerate(S) as iteration source
  - Loop body contains two consecutive append operations

- Data Processing:
  - Character-by-character interleaving of S and T
  - Sequential list construction with O(n) space complexity

- Dependencies:
  - Standard input/output functions (no external libraries required)
