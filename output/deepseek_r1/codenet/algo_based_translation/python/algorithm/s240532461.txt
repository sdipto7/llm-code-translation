- **Input**: Read integers N (int) and L (int) from standard input.
- **Variables**:
  - aji (List[int]) initialized as empty list.
- **Loop**:
  - For each i in range 1 to N (inclusive):
    - Append (L + i - 1) to aji.
- **Conditionals**:
  - If minimum value in aji is >= 0:
    - Remove the first occurrence of the minimum value in aji.
  - Else if maximum value in aji is <= 0:
    - Remove the first occurrence of the maximum value in aji.
  - Else:
    - Remove the first occurrence of the element with smallest absolute value in aji.
- **Output**: Compute sum of all elements in aji and print result as integer.
- **Data Flow**:
  - All operations use built-in list methods and arithmetic; no external dependencies required.
