Function Signatures:
- Function main() with no parameters returning void

Variables:
- s1: string (from first input)
- s2: string (from second input)
- count: integer (initialized to 0)
- min_length: integer (minimum of lengths of s1 and s2)

Logic Flow:
1. Read s1 from standard input
2. Read s2 from standard input
3. Initialize count = 0
4. Set min_length = minimum value between len(s1) and len(s2)
5. For i from 0 to min_length - 1 (inclusive):
   a. If s1[i] == s2[i]:
       i. Increment count by 1
6. Print count as decimal integer

Control Structures:
- Single loop iterating from 0 to min_length-1
- Conditional check for character equality within loop

Input/Output:
- Reads two strings via sequential input operations
- Processes character comparisons up to shorter string length
- Outputs final count via print statement

Dependencies:
- Requires access to standard input/output functions
- Implicit string manipulation and length operations
- Comparison operator for character equality checks
