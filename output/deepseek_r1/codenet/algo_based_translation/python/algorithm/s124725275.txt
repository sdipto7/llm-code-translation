**Algorithm:**

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - Read integers H, W from input.
   - Read start coordinates (si, sj) and end coordinates (ti, tj), adjusted to 0-based indexing by subtracting 1.
   - Read H lines of grid data, converting each cell to 1 (wall) or 0 (passable) based on '#' and '.'.

2. **Data Initialization:**
   - Initialize a 2D distance array D with dimensions HxW, filled with -1 (unvisited).
   - Create a deque and insert the starting position (si, sj) with cost 0.

3. **Processing Loop:**
   - While the deque is not empty:
     a. Dequeue the front element (current cost c, coordinates i, j).
     b. If D[i][j] is already visited (≠ -1), skip processing.
     c. Set D[i][j] = c.
     d. For all 25 possible neighbor cells (di, dj) in the range ±2:
        i. Calculate new coordinates ni = i + di, nj = j + dj.
        ii. Check boundaries: ni ∈ [0, H-1], nj ∈ [0, W-1].
        iii. Check if cell is unvisited (D[ni][nj] == -1) and passable (S[ni][nj] == 0).
        iv. If valid:
            - If movement is direct adjacent (|di| ≤1, |dj| ≤1, and either di or dj is 0):
                * Add (ni, nj) to front of deque with cost c (prioritize).
            - Else (warp movement):
                * Add (ni, nj) to end of deque with cost c + 1.

4. **Termination:**
   - Output D[ti][tj] (cost to reach target) after processing completes.

**Data Structures:**
- Deque (double-ended queue) for 0-1 BFS, enabling O(1) insertion at both ends.
- 2D array D for tracking minimum warp costs.
- 2D array S representing the grid (0=passable, 1=blocked).

**Control Flow:**
- Main loop processes cells in deque order, prioritizing adjacent moves (cost 0) over warps (cost 1).
- All 25 neighboring cells are evaluated for each processed cell.

**Dependencies:**
- Requires `sys` for input handling and `collections.deque` for efficient queue operations.
