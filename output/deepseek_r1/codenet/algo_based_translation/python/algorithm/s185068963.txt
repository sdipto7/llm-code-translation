Function signatures with parameter and return types:  
- No explicit functions (script execution)  

Variable declarations and data types:  
- `a: int`  
- `b: int`  
- `c: int`  

Complete logic flow in execution order:  
1. Read input line as string  
2. Split input into three string tokens  
3. Convert tokens to integers `a`, `b`, `c`  
4. Compute `a + b`  
5. Compare result with `c`:  
   - If `a + b >= c`: print "Yes"  
   - Else: print "No"  

All control structures with exact conditions:  
- Conditional: `if a + b >= c`  

Input/output operations and data processing logic:  
- Input: Single line with three space-separated integers  
- Output: "Yes" or "No" based on comparison result  

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:  
- None (uses built-in functions)
