1. Input Operations:
   - Read two integers X and N from the first input line
   - Read N integers from the second input line into list p

2. Data Processing:
   - Sort list p in ascending order
   - Initialize empty dictionary candidates with integer keys and list of integers as values

3. Loop through integers i from -1 to 101 (inclusive):
   - If i exists in p: skip to next iteration
   - Calculate absolute difference: diff = |X - i|
   - If diff not in candidates: create new entry with diff as key and [i] as value
   - Else: append i to existing list in candidates[diff]

4. Find smallest key in candidates dictionary:
   - smallest = minimum value among all keys in candidates

5. Find minimum value in candidates[smallest] list:
   - minNum = minimum integer in the list stored at candidates[smallest]

6. Output Operation:
   - Print minNum

Variables:
- X: integer
- N: integer
- p: list of integers
- candidates: dictionary (key: integer, value: list of integers)
- i: integer (loop variable)
- diff: integer
- smallest: integer
- minNum: integer

Control Structures:
- For loop: iterate i from -1 to 101 (inclusive)
- Conditional: if i in p -> continue
- Conditional: if diff not in candidates -> initialize entry, else append
- Dictionary operations (key checks, list modifications)
- Minimum value determination for dictionary keys
- Minimum value determination in list

Dependencies:
- Standard input handling via input().split()
- List and dictionary operations
- Built-in functions: map(), sort(), min(), abs()
