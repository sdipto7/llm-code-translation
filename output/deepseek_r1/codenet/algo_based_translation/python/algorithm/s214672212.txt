- Function signature:  
  (Script-based execution, no explicit function)

- Variables:  
  nums: list<int>  

- Input operations:  
  Read line from standard input  
  Split input string by spaces into list<string>  
  Convert list elements to integers using map  
  Store result in nums  

- Data processing:  
  Sort nums in descending order (mutates list)  

- Computation:  
  Calculate result as (nums[0] * 10) + nums[1] + nums[2]  

- Output operations:  
  Print computed result as integer  

- Execution flow:  
  1. Read and parse input  
  2. Sort list descending  
  3. Compute value from first three elements  
  4. Output result  

- Dependencies:  
  Uses built-in functions only (input, map, list, sort, print)
