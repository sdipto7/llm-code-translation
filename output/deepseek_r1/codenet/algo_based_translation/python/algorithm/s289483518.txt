- **Function Signature**: N/A (Script-based execution)
- **Input Operations**:
  - Read integers `n` (array size) and `m` (number of operations) from standard input.
  - Read `n` integers from standard input into list `a`.
  - Read `m` lines, each containing two integers (count, value) into list `ope`.
- **Data Types**:
  - `n`: integer
  - `m`: integer
  - `a`: list of integers (initially empty, populated from input)
  - `ope`: list of lists (each sublist contains two integers: count and value)
  - `j`: integer (initialized to 0)
- **Data Processing**:
  - Sort `a` in ascending order.
  - Sort `ope` in descending order based on the second element (value) of each sublist.
- **Control Flow**:
  - Loop over each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`):
    - If `j` exceeds the length of `ope`, terminate loop.
    - If `a[i] < ope[j][1]`:
      - Replace `a[i]` with `ope[j][1]`.
      - Decrement `ope[j][0]` by 1.
      - If `ope[j][0]` becomes 0:
        - Increment `j` by 1.
        - If `j` equals the length of `ope`, terminate loop.
    - Else:
      - Terminate loop (no further replacements needed due to sorted order).
- **Output Operation**:
  - Calculate and print the sum of all elements in `a`.
- **Termination Conditions**:
  - Loop ends when all elements of `a` are processed, all operations are exhausted, or an element in `a` is >= current operation value.
