- Input integer n from standard input
- Initialize a as empty list
- For i in range(2):
  - Read line from input, split into integers, convert to list, append to a
- Reverse the second list in a
- Import numpy module
- Compute res_0 as numpy cumulative sum of first list in a (res_0[i] = sum(a[0][0..i]))
- Compute res_1 as numpy cumulative sum of reversed second list (res_1[i] = sum(a[1][0..i]))
- Initialize ans = 0 (integer)
- For i from 0 to n-1 inclusive:
  - check = res_0[i] + res_1[n-1-i]
  - If check > ans:
    - Set ans = check
- Output ans to standard output
- Required dependency: numpy
