- Function: main()
- Inputs: None (reads from stdin)
- Output: Writes integer to stdout
- Variables:
  - N: integer
  - a: list of integers
  - s: list of integers
- Execution flow:
  1. Read integer N from standard input
  2. Read line from input, split into list of integers, store in a
  3. Sort list a in ascending order (in-place)
  4. Create new list s containing elements from a starting at index N, selecting every 2nd element (indices N, N+2, N+4...)
  5. Calculate sum of all elements in list s
  6. Print calculated sum to standard output
- Control structures:
  - Slice operation [N::2] with start=N, stop=implicit end, step=2
- Data processing:
  - List comprehension for creating s
  - Built-in sum() function for aggregation
- Dependencies: None (uses Python standard input/output and built-in functions)
