Function signature:
- main() -> None

Variables:
- N: integer (user input)
- H: list of integers (user input)
- count_best: integer (initialized to 0)
- count_tmp: integer (initialized to 0)
- i: integer (loop index from 0 to N-2)

Logic Flow:
1. Read integer N from standard input
2. Read and parse space-separated integers into list H
3. Initialize count_best = 0
4. Initialize count_tmp = 0
5. For i in range 0 to N-2 (inclusive):
    a. If H[i] >= H[i+1]:
        i. Increment count_tmp by 1
    b. Else:
        i. If count_tmp > count_best:
            - Set count_best = count_tmp
        ii. Reset count_tmp to 0
6. After loop completion:
    a. If count_tmp > count_best:
        - Set count_best = count_tmp
7. Print count_best as final output

Control Structures:
- For loop: Iterates N-1 times (from 0 to N-2)
- Nested if-else structure inside loop:
    - Primary condition: H[i] >= H[i+1]
    - Secondary condition: count_tmp > count_best (in else clause)
- Post-loop conditional check: count_tmp > count_best

Input/Output:
- Input operations:
    - First input line: integer N
    - Second input line: space-separated integers for H list
- Output operation:
    - Print final value of count_best

Dependencies:
- None required beyond standard input/output functions
