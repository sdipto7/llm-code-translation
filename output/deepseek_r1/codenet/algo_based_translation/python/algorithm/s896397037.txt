1. **Input Operation**: Read a string from standard input. Convert it to a list of characters.  
   - Variable: `s` (type: `List[str]`), initialized as `s = list(input().strip())`  

2. **Data Processing**: Sort the list `s` in lexicographical order.  
   - Operation: `s.sort()`  

3. **Conditional Check**:  
   - **If** all of the following are true:  
     - `s[0] == s[1]` (first two characters are equal)  
     - `s[0] != s[2]` (first character differs from third)  
     - `s[2] == s[3]` (third and fourth characters are equal)  
   - **Then**: Print "Yes"  
   - **Else**: Print "No"  

4. **Output Operation**: Print "Yes" or "No" based on the conditional check.  
   - Function: `print("Yes")` or `print("No")`  

**Function Signature**:  
- Implicit procedure with no parameters or return value.  

**Control Flow**:  
1. Sequential execution of input, sorting, and conditional check.  
2. Single `if-else` block controlling output.  

**Dependencies**:  
- Python standard library (no external modules required).  

**Assumptions**:  
- Input string length is exactly 4 characters (code will fail otherwise).
