- Input operations:
  - Read integer `n` from standard input
  - Read line from input containing `n` space-separated integers, convert to list `a`
- Variable declarations:
  - `n`: integer type
  - `a`: list of integers
  - `below`: float type initialized to 0.0
- Logic flow:
  1. Initialize reciprocal sum variable: `below = 0.0`
  2. Iterate through each element in list `a` using index-based loop:
     - Loop control: `for i in range(n):`
     - Operation: `below += 1.0 / a[i]`
  3. Calculate final result as reciprocal of `below`
  4. Output result using `print(1.0 / below)`
- Control structures:
  - Single for loop with range iteration from 0 to n-1 (inclusive)
- Data processing:
  - Convert input string to list of integers
  - Floating-point division in reciprocal calculations
  - Accumulate sum of reciprocals
  - Final reciprocal operation for harmonic mean calculation
- Dependencies: None (uses standard input/output functions only)
