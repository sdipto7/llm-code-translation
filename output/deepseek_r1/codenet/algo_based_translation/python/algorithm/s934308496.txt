- Function: main()
  - Parameters: None
  - Return: None
- Variables:
  - n: integer
  - x: integer
  - m: list of integers
  - sum_m: integer
  - remaining: integer
  - additional: integer
  - total: integer
- Logic Flow:
  1. Read first input line as two space-separated integers → n, x
  2. Read next n input lines as integers → store in list m
  3. Sort list m in ascending order
  4. Calculate sum_m = sum of all elements in m
  5. Calculate remaining = x - sum_m
  6. Calculate additional = remaining // m[0] (integer division)
  7. Calculate total = n + additional
  8. Print total as output
- Control Structures:
  - Implicit loop for list comprehension during input reading (n iterations)
- Input/Output:
  - Input: Read from standard input (first line: n,x; next n lines: elements of m)
  - Output: Write integer total to standard output
- Dependencies: None (uses built-in Python functions)
