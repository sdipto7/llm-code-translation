Function Signatures:
- No explicit functions (executed as script)

Variables:
- n: int
- m: int
- a: list[int]
- b: list[int]
- a1: int
- b1: int
- i: int (loop counter)

Logic Flow:
1. Read input line, split into n and m using map(int, input().split())
2. Initialize a and b as empty lists
3. Loop for m iterations:
   a. Read a1 and b1 from input using map(int, input().split())
   b. Append a1 to list a
   c. Append b1 to list b
4. Loop i from 1 to n (inclusive):
   a. Calculate sum of a.count(i) and b.count(i)
   b. Print the sum

Control Structures:
- for i in range(m): (loop exactly m times)
- for i in range(1, n+1): (loop from 1 to n inclusive)

Input/Output:
- Read n and m from first input line
- Read m lines, each containing two integers for a1 and b1
- Print n lines, each containing the degree of vertex i (sum of occurrences in a and b)

Libraries/Dependencies:
- None (uses built-in functions and standard input/output)
