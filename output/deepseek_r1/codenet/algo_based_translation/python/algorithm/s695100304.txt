1. Input Operations:
   - Read integer `n` from standard input via `input()` and convert to int
   - Read space-separated values from next input line, convert to list of integers `x` (length n implied)
2. Data Processing:
   - Reverse order of elements in list `x` using in-place reversal method `x.reverse()`
3. Output Operation:
   - Print reversed list elements space-separated using unpack operator `*x`
4. Variables:
   - n: int (number of elements, though not directly used after input)
   - x: List[int] (stores input numbers and reversed result)
5. Execution Flow:
   - Sequential execution without loops/conditionals
   - All operations performed in main scope (no functions)
6. Dependencies:
   - Uses Python built-in functions (input, int, map, list, print)
   - No external libraries/modules required
