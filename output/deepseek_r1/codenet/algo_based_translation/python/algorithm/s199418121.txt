**Algorithm**

**Function Signature**  
No explicit functions. Executes as a script.

**Variables**  
- `A`: string (initially), converted to integer  
- `B`: string (initially), processed to remove decimal point and converted to integer  

**Input Operations**  
1. Read a line from standard input.  
2. Split input into two strings `A` and `B` using whitespace as the delimiter.  

**Data Processing**  
1. Convert `A` to an integer.  
2. Remove all occurrences of '.' in `B` and convert the result to an integer.  

**Computation**  
1. Multiply integer `A` by integer `B`.  
2. Perform integer division of the product by 100.  

**Output Operation**  
1. Print the result of the division.  

**Control Structures**  
No loops or conditionals. Execution follows strict sequential order.  

**Dependencies**  
None (uses only built-in Python functions).
