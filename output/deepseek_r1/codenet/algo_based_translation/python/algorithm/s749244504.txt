- **Libraries/Dependencies**:
  - `itertools.chain`
  - `numpy` (as `np`)
  - `networkx` (as `nx`)

- **Variables**:
  - `X`: iterator of input lines (type: iterator)
  - `h`, `w`: integers from input
  - `C`: 10x10 matrix (numpy array of integers)
  - `A`: h x w matrix (numpy array of integers)
  - `G`: directed graph (networkx.DiGraph)
  - `d`: dictionary mapping integers to integers (keys: 0-9 except 1, values: shortest path lengths)
  - `s`: integer sum (initialized to 0)

- **Input Operations**:
  1. Read first line: split into `h` and `w` (integers)
  2. Read next 10 lines: populate `C` matrix with 10 integers per line
  3. Read next `h` lines: populate `A` matrix with `w` integers per line

- **Logic Flow**:
  1. Initialize `X` as iterator over all input lines
  2. Parse `h` and `w` from first line
  3. Populate `C` by iterating 10 times, splitting each line into 10 integers
  4. Populate `A` by iterating `h` times, splitting each line into `w` integers
  5. Create directed graph `G` with edge weights from `C`
  6. Compute shortest path lengths:
     - For each `i` in 0-9:
       - Skip `i=1`
       - Calculate shortest path from `i` to 1 in `G` using edge weights
       - Store result in `d[i]`
  7. Calculate total sum `s`:
     - Flatten `A` into 1D sequence using `chain.from_iterable`
     - For each value `a` in flattened `A`:
       - Skip if `a` is -1 or 1
       - Add `d[a]` to `s`
  8. Print `s`

- **Control Structures**:
  - Nested loops for populating `C` (10 rows, 10 columns)
  - Nested loops for populating `A` (`h` rows, `w` columns)
  - Loop over 0-9 for shortest path computation (excluding `i=1`)
  - Conditional check `if i == 1: continue` in shortest path loop
  - Loop over flattened `A` with conditional check `if a == -1 or a == 1: continue`

- **Output Operation**:
  - Print final value of `s`
