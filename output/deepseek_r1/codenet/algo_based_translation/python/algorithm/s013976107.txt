**Function Signature:**  
No explicit function (executes as script)  

**Variables:**  
- `A`: Integer  
- `B`: Integer  
- `S`: List of strings (characters)  

**Input Operations:**  
1. Read two integers `A` and `B` from standard input, split by whitespace.  
2. Read a string `S` from standard input and convert it to a list of characters.  

**Logic Flow:**  
1. Check if the character at index `A` in `S` is equal to `'-'`.  
2. Simultaneously check if the total count of `'-'` in `S` is exactly `1`.  
3. If both conditions are true, print `"Yes"`.  
4. Otherwise, print `"No"`.  

**Control Structures:**  
- Single `if` statement with compound condition:  
  - `if S[A] == '-' and S.count('-') == 1`  

**Output Operations:**  
- Print `"Yes"` or `"No"` based on the condition result.  

**Dependencies:**  
- No external libraries/modules required. Uses standard input/output functions.
