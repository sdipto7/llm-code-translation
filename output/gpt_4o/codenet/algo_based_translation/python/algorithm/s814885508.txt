```
Function Signature:
- main() -> None

Variable Declarations:
- X: int
- K: int
- D: int
- r: int
- a: int

Logic Flow:
1. Read input values, split by spaces, and convert them to integers:
   - Assign these values to X, K, and D, respectively.
   
2. Calculate the integer division of X by D:
   - Assign the result to variable r.

3. Conditional Check:
   - If the absolute value of r is greater than K:
     - Output the value of (absolute value of X) minus (K multiplied by D).
     - Terminate the program.

4. Calculate the remaining distance:
   - Subtract (r multiplied by D) from X and assign to variable a.

5. Conditional Check:
   - If (K minus r) is even:
     - Output the value of a.
   - Otherwise:
     - Output the absolute value of (D minus a).

Required Libraries:
- No external libraries or modules are required.
