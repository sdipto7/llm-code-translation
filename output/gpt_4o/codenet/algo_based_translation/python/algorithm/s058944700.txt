Function Signature:
    def calculate_minimum_distance(n: int, k: int) -> int

Variable Declarations:
    tmp: int
    ans: int

Logic Flow:
1. Read two integers from input, n and k.
2. Check if n is greater than k:
   a. Calculate tmp as the remainder of n divided by k (tmp = n % k).
   b. If tmp is greater than or equal to (k - tmp), set ans to (k - tmp).
   c. Otherwise, set ans to tmp.
3. Else, check if n is less than k:
   a. If n is greater than or equal to (k - n), set ans to (k - n).
   b. Otherwise, set ans to n.
4. Else, set ans to 0 (this handles the case where n equals k).
5. Print the value of ans.

Dependencies:
- numpy module is imported but not used.
- Input is read from standard input.
- Output is printed to standard output.
