Algorithm

1. Function Signature:
   - None (This script is executed without encapsulating in a function)

2. Variable Declarations:
   - X: int
   - N: int
   - p: List[int]
   - candidates: Dict[int, List[int]]
   - i: int
   - smallest: int
   - minNum: int

3. Execution Flow:
   a. Read input:
      - Read a line of input, split by space, and map to integers. Assign the first value to X and the second to N.
      - Read another line of input, split by space, and map to integers. Assign the list to p.

   b. Sort the list p.

   c. Initialize an empty dictionary `candidates`.

   d. Loop from -1 to 101 (inclusive):
      - For each integer i:
        i. Check if i is in list p:
           - If true, continue to the next iteration.
        ii. Calculate the absolute difference abs(X - i).
        iii. If this difference is not already a key in `candidates`:
           - Add a new entry: `candidates[abs(X-i)] = [i]`
        iv. Else, append i to the list at `candidates[abs(X-i)]`.

   e. Find the smallest key in `candidates` and assign it to `smallest`.

   f. Find the smallest integer in `candidates[smallest]` and assign it to `minNum`.

   g. Output:
      - Print the value of `minNum`.
