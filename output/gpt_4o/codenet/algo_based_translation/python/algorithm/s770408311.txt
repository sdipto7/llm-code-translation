Function Signature:
- No specific function is defined; the code is executed in the global scope.

Variables:
- `n`: integer, represents the number of input strings.
- `res`: list of strings, stores the input strings.
- `a`: string, holds each user input string in the loop.

Logic Flow:
1. Read an integer from input and assign it to `n`.
2. Initialize an empty list `res`.
3. Execute a loop that iterates `n` times:
   - In each iteration, read a string from input and assign it to `a`.
   - Append the string `a` to the list `res`.
4. Convert `res` to a set to remove duplicates and determine the number of unique strings.
5. Print the length of the set, which represents the number of unique strings.

Control Structures:
- A `for` loop that iterates from 0 to `n-1`, inclusive.

Input/Output:
- Input: Reads an integer followed by `n` strings from standard input.
- Output: Prints the number of unique strings.

Libraries/Modules:
- No external libraries or modules are required for execution.
