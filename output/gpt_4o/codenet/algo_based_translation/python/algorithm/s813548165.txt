```
1. Begin the algorithm execution.

2. Declare an integer variable `N`.

3. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to `N`.

4. Declare two string variables `S` and `T`.

5. Read a line of input, split it by spaces, and assign the first part to `S` and the second part to `T`.

6. Declare a list `char_lists` to store characters, data type: List[str].

7. Initialize a loop to iterate over each character index `i` in the string `S` using `enumerate(S)`:
   a. Retrieve the character `char` at index `i` from string `S`.
   b. Append `char` to the list `char_lists`.
   c. Append the character at index `i` from string `T` to the list `char_lists`.

8. Convert the list `char_lists` to a string by joining its elements.

9. Print the resulting string.

10. End the algorithm execution.
