Algorithm CheckDivisibilityByNine
    Input: None
    Output: Print 'Yes' or 'No'

    Step 1: Read input from the user and store it in variable N
        Input: N (user input, initially string)

    Step 2: Check if N is equal to the integer 0
        If N is equal to 0 then
            Print 'Yes'
        Else
            Proceed to Step 3

    Step 3: Convert N to a string (if not already a string)

    Step 4: Convert the string N to a list of its characters
        Declare: L as List of characters from N

    Step 5: Convert each character in list L to an integer
        Update L: List of integers

    Step 6: Calculate the sum of integers in list L
        Declare: X as Integer, X = sum(L)

    Step 7: Check if X is divisible by 9
        If X modulo 9 is equal to 0 then
            Print 'Yes'
        Else
            Print 'No'
