```
Function signature:
    function process_numbers(A: int, B: int, K: int) -> None

Variable declarations:
    A, B, K: integers
    i: integer initialized to 0

Logic flow:
    Read three space-separated integers from input and assign them to A, B, K
    If condition A + K - 1 >= B - K + 1:
        While A <= B:
            Output the value of A
            Increment A by 1
    Else:
        Initialize i to 0
        While i <= K - 1:
            Output the value of A + i
            Increment i by 1
        While B - K + 1 <= B:
            Output the value of B - K + 1
            Decrement K by 1

Control structures:
    Conditional: if A + K - 1 >= B - K + 1
    Loop: while A <= B
    Loop: while i <= K - 1
    Loop: while B - K + 1 <= B

Input/Output operations:
    Input: Read space-separated integers and assign to A, B, K
    Output: Print integers based on conditions

Required libraries:
    None
