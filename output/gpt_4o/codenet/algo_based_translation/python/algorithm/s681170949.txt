1. Function signature:
   - No function is defined; the code is executed in the main block.

2. Variable declarations and data types:
   - N: string

3. Complete logic flow:
   - Read input from the user and store it as a string in the variable `N`.
   - Concatenate the string "ABC" with the string `N`.
   - Print the concatenated result.

4. Control structures:
   - No loops or conditionals are present in the code.

5. Input/output operations:
   - Input: Use `input()` to read a string from the user.
   - Output: Use `print()` to display the concatenated string "ABC" and the user input.

6. Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
   - No external libraries or modules are required.
