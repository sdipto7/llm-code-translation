Function Signature:
    def find_max_sum(n: int, a: List[List[int]]) -> int

Variable Declarations:
    a: List[List[int]]
    res_0: numpy.ndarray
    res_1: numpy.ndarray
    ans: int
    check: int

Algorithm:
1. Initialize an empty list `a` to hold two lists of integers.
2. For `i` ranging from 0 to 1 (inclusive), perform the following:
   a. Read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each part to an integer, and append the resulting list to `a`.
3. Reverse the second list in `a` (i.e., `a[1]`).
4. Import the `numpy` module.
5. Calculate the cumulative sum of the first list in `a` using `numpy.cumsum` and store it in `res_0`.
6. Calculate the cumulative sum of the reversed second list in `a` using `numpy.cumsum` and store it in `res_1`.
7. Initialize `ans` to 0.
8. For `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive), perform the following:
   a. Calculate `check` as the sum of `res_0[i]` and `res_1[n-1-i]`.
   b. Update `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `check`.
9. Output the value of `ans`.
