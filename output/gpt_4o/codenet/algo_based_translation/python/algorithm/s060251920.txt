Function Signature:
- `main()` with no parameters and no return type

Variable Declarations:
- `a` is an integer
- `b` is an integer

Execution Order:
1. Read a single line of input from the user.
2. Use `map()` to apply the `int` conversion function to each item in the input split by spaces, resulting in two integers.
3. Assign the first integer to variable `a`.
4. Assign the second integer to variable `b`.
5. Calculate the product of `a` and `b`.
6. Print the result of the multiplication.

Control Structures:
- No loops or conditionals

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read a line of user input
- Output: Print the integer result of the multiplication

Required Libraries:
- None
