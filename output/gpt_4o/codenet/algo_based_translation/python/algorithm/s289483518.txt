Function Signature: process_numbers(n: int, m: int, a: List[int], operations: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int

Variables:
- n: int, number of elements in list a
- m: int, number of operations
- a: List[int], list of integers
- operations: List[Tuple[int, int]], list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (b, c)
- j: int, index to track the current operation in operations
- merged_operations: List[Tuple[int, int]], sorted list of operations based on the second element in descending order

Algorithm:
1. Sort the list `a` in ascending order.
2. Sort the list `operations` based on the second element of each tuple in descending order and assign it to `merged_operations`.
3. Initialize `j` to 0 to track the current operation from `merged_operations`.
4. Iterate over the indices `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
   - If `a[i]` is less than `merged_operations[j][1]`:
     - Assign `merged_operations[j][1]` to `a[i]`.
     - Decrement `merged_operations[j][0]` by 1.
     - If `merged_operations[j][0]` becomes 0:
       - Increment `j` by 1.
       - If `j` equals the length of `merged_operations`, break the loop.
   - Otherwise, break the loop.
5. Return the sum of the list `a`.
