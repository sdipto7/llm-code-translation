Function: calculate_sequence(n: int, a: List[int]) -> List[int]
  Input:
    - n: Integer, the number of elements in the list 'a'
    - a: List of integers, input sequence of numbers
  Output:
    - List of integers, processed sequence as described

  Variable Declarations:
    - m1: Integer, initialized to the sum of a list comprehension divided by 2
    - result: String, representation of m1
    - m: List of integers, size n, initialized with None values
    - i: Integer, loop index

  Execution Logic:
    1. Compute m1:
       a. Initialize m1 to the integer division of the sum of a list comprehension by 2.
       b. The list comprehension iterates over indices from 0 to n-1.
       c. For each index i, compute a[i] multiplied by (-1) raised to the power of i.
       d. Sum all results of the list comprehension.

    2. Initialize result as the string representation of m1.

    3. Initialize m as a list of None with size n.
    
    4. Set m[0] to m1.

    5. Loop from i = 1 to n-1:
       a. Set m[i] to the value of a[i-1] minus m[i-1].

    6. Prepare the output:
       a. Create a list by multiplying each element of m by 2.
       b. Convert each element to a string.

    7. Output the result:
       a. Join the list of strings with a space delimiter and print the result.
