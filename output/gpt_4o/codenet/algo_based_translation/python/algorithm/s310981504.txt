Algorithm:

1. Function Signature:
   - Define a function `compare_and_print` with no parameters and no return type.

2. Variable Declarations:
   - Declare variables `a` and `b` of type `int`.

3. Input Operations:
   - Read a line of input from the user.
   - Split the input string into two parts based on the space character.
   - Convert each part into an integer.
   - Assign the first integer to `a` and the second integer to `b`.

4. Control Flow:
   - Use an `if` statement to check if `a` is less than or equal to `b`.
     - If true, execute the following step:
       - Print the value of `a`.
   - Use an `else` statement for the case when the above condition is false.
     - Execute the following step:
       - Print the value of `a - 1`.

5. Output Operations:
   - The output is printed directly to the console. No return value from the function.

6. Dependencies:
   - No external libraries or modules are required.
