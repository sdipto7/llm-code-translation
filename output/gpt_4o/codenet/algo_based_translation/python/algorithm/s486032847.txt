1. Import the `math` module.
2. Define a function `keta(s: str) -> int`:
   - Check if the length of string `s` is less than 2:
     - Convert `s` to an integer and return it.
   - Otherwise, compute the sum of the integer values of each character in `s`.
   - Recursively call `keta` with the string representation of the computed sum and return the result.
3. Define the `main()` function:
   - Read input from the user and store it in variable `N` as a string.
   - Call the `keta` function with `N`, check if the result is divisible by 9:
     - If true, output "Yes".
     - Otherwise, output "No".
4. If the script is executed as the main program, call the `main()` function.
