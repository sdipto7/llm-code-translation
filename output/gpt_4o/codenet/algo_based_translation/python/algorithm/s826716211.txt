Function: solve() -> None

Variable Declarations:
- S_d: List[str]
- T: List[str]
- end: int
- first: int
- t_i: int
- s_i: int
- ans: List[str]

Logic Flow:
1. Read input string and convert to list of characters, assign to S_d
2. Read input string and convert to list of characters, assign to T
3. Calculate end as the last index of S_d
4. Calculate first as the starting index for matching, which is end minus the length of T plus 1
5. Start a while loop with condition: first >= 0
   a. Initialize t_i to 0
   b. Start a for loop with s_i ranging from first to end (inclusive)
      i. Check if T[t_i] is not equal to S_d[s_i] and S_d[s_i] is not a '?'
         - If true, break out of the for loop
      ii. Increment t_i by 1
   c. If the for loop completes without breaking, break out of the while loop
   d. Decrement first by 1
   e. Decrement end by 1
6. If the while loop completes without breaking, print 'UNRESTORABLE' and exit
7. Copy S_d to ans
8. Initialize t_i to 0
9. Start a for loop with i ranging from first to end (inclusive)
   a. Assign T[t_i] to ans[i]
   b. Increment t_i by 1
10. Convert ans list to a string, replacing '?' with 'a'
11. Print the resulting string
