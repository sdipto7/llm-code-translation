Algorithm count_distinct_adjacent_segments:
    Input: 
        N (integer) - the number of characters in the string S
        S (string) - the string of length N consisting of characters
    
    Output:
        integer - the count of distinct adjacent segments in the string S
    
    Variables:
        x (integer) - initialized to 1, to count distinct segments
    
    Execution:
        Set x to 1
        For i from 0 to N-2, do:
            If S[i] is not equal to S[i+1], then:
                Increment x by 1
        Return x
