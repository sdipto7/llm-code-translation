```
Function Signature:
    function calculate_average(A: int, B: int) -> str

Algorithm:
1. Receive two integer inputs A and B.
2. Calculate the sum of A and B and store it in a variable, say total_sum.
3. Check if total_sum is odd by evaluating the condition (total_sum % 2 == 1).
4. If the condition in step 3 is true, return the string 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
5. If the condition in step 3 is false, compute the integer division of total_sum by 2.
6. Return the result of the division from step 5 as a string.
