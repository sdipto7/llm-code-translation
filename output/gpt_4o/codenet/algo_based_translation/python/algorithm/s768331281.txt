```
Function signature:
    function sort_strings(N: int, L: int, strings: List[str]) -> str

Variable declarations:
    N: int
    L: int
    S: List[str]

Execution logic:
1. Read two integers from input and assign them to N and L.
2. Initialize an empty list S to store the strings.
3. For each index from 0 to N-1, perform the following:
    a. Read a string from input, strip any trailing whitespace, and add it to the list S.
4. Sort the list S in ascending lexicographical order.
5. Concatenate all strings in the sorted list S into a single string.
6. Print the concatenated string.

Control structures:
- A loop that iterates N times to read strings.

Input/Output operations:
- Input: Read two integers N and L.
- Input: Read N strings.
- Output: Print the concatenated sorted strings.

Dependencies:
- Requires standard input/output functions.
- Requires list and string operations.
