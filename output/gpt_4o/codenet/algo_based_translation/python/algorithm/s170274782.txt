```
Algorithm:

1. Input:
   - Read an integer `N` from input, representing the number of elements in each list.
   - Initialize an empty list `A` of type List[List[int]].

2. Data Collection:
   - Loop 2 times (to collect two lists):
     - Read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and store the list in `A`.

3. Initialize Variables:
   - Create an empty list `ans` of type List[int] to store results.
   - Declare an integer `count` and initialize it to 0.

4. Generate Results:
   - Loop over each index `i` from 0 to `N-1`:
     - Assign `A[0]` to `baselis`.
     - Assign `A[1]` to `groundlis`.
     - Reset `count` to 0.
     - Update `count` by adding:
       - The sum of elements from the start to index `i` (inclusive) in `baselis`.
       - The sum of elements from index `i` to `N` (inclusive) in `groundlis`.
     - Append `count` to `ans`.

5. Output:
   - Print the maximum value in `ans`.

Dependencies:
