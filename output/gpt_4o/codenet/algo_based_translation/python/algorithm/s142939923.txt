Function: calculate_max_operation(a: int, b: int) -> int

Variables:
- a: int
- b: int
- results: List[int]

Input:
- Read a line of input containing two space-separated integers.
- Extract integers a and b from the input.

Logic:
1. Initialize a list named results.
2. Perform the following arithmetic operations:
   a. Calculate the sum of a and b. Append the result to results.
   b. Calculate the difference of a and b (a - b). Append the result to results.
   c. Calculate the product of a and b. Append the result to results.
3. Determine the maximum value in the results list.

Output:
- Return the maximum value from the list of results.
