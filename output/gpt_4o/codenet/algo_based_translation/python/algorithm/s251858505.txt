Algorithm CompareAndCountMatchingCharacters

Input: 
    - Two strings from user input

Output:
    - An integer representing the count of character positions where the two strings are equal

Variables:
    - string1: String
    - string2: String
    - totalMatchCount: Integer
    - compareResult: List of Booleans

Libraries:
    - None required

Step 1: Read string1 from user input
Step 2: Read string2 from user input
Step 3: Initialize totalMatchCount to 0
Step 4: Initialize compareResult as an empty list
Step 5: For each pair of characters (x, y) from string1 and string2 respectively:
        a. Check if x is equal to y
        b. If equal, append True to compareResult
        c. If not equal, append False to compareResult
Step 6: Calculate totalMatchCount as the sum of True values in compareResult
Step 7: Print totalMatchCount

End Algorithm
