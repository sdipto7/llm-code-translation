Algorithm:

Function Signature:
- Function name: calculate_value
- Parameters: None
- Return type: None (prints output directly)

Variable Declarations:
- A, B, C: Integers

Execution Flow:
1. Input operation:
   - Read a single line of input from the user.
   - Split the input string into three parts and convert each part to an integer.
   - Assign these integers to variables A, B, and C, respectively.

2. Conditional Logic:
   - Check if B is less than C:
     - If true, print the integer 0.
   - Else, check if the product of A and C is less than B:
     - If true, print the integer value of C.
   - Else, perform integer division of B by A and print the result.
  
Control Structures:
- If-Else conditional statements with exact conditions as described above.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Single line of space-separated integers from standard input.
- Output: Single integer printed to standard output based on the conditional logic.

Dependencies:
- None (No external libraries or modules required)
