Algorithm: Count visible mountains

1. Function Signature:
   - Function name: count_visible_mountains
   - Parameters: 
     - N: int (the number of mountains)
     - Hs: List[int] (a list containing the heights of the mountains)
   - Return type: int (the count of visible mountains)

2. Variable Declarations:
   - ans: int (initially set to 0, to count the number of visible mountains)
   - maxH: int (initially set to 0, to track the maximum height encountered so far)

3. Logic Flow:
   a. Initialize variable `ans` to 0.
   b. Initialize variable `maxH` to 0.
   
4. Loop through each height `H` in the list `Hs`:
   - Condition: Iterate over each element in `Hs`.
   - For each iteration:
     i. Check if `maxH` is less than or equal to `H`.
        - If true:
          a. Increment `ans` by 1.
          b. Update `maxH` to the value of `H`.

5. After the loop ends, return the value of `ans`.

6. Input/Output Operations:
   - Input: Read an integer `N` (the number of mountains) and a list `Hs` of `N` integers representing the heights of the mountains.
   - Output: Print the integer `ans` representing the number of visible mountains.

7. No external libraries, modules, or dependencies are required.
