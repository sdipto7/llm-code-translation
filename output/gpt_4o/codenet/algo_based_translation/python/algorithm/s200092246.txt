```
- Function Signature:
  - main() -> None

- Variable Declarations:
  - N: int
  - ans: List[int] initialized as an empty list
  - i: int (used in loops)

- Input/Output Operations:
  - Read an integer from input and assign it to N

- Logic Flow:
  1. Initialize an empty list `ans`
  2. Loop `i` from 1 to N (inclusive):
     - Calculate the sum of integers from 1 to `i`
     - If the sum is less than `N`, continue to the next iteration
     - Else, assign `[i - 1, sum(range(1, i + 1)) - N]` to `ans`
     - Break out of the loop
  3. Loop `i` from 0 to `ans[0]` (inclusive):
     - If `i + 1` is not equal to `ans[1]`, print `i + 1`

- No required libraries, modules, or dependencies
