1. Input: Read two integers from input and assign them to variables `N` and `L`.

2. Variable Declarations:
   - `N`: Integer, represents the number of elements.
   - `L`: Integer, represents the starting integer for the sequence.
   - `aji`: List of integers, initialized as an empty list.

3. Loop: For each integer `i` from 1 to `N` (inclusive):
   - Calculate `L + i - 1` and append the result to the list `aji`.

4. Conditional Statements:
   - If the minimum value in `aji` is greater than or equal to 0:
     - Remove the minimum value in `aji` from the list.
   - Else if the maximum value in `aji` is less than or equal to 0:
     - Remove the maximum value in `aji` from the list.
   - Else:
     - Remove the value in `aji` that has the minimum absolute value.

5. Output: Calculate and print the sum of the elements in the modified `aji` list.

6. No libraries, modules, or dependencies are required.
