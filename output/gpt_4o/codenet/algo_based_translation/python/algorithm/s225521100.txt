Algorithm:
1. Function Signature:
   - Function name: calculate_unmarked_positions
   - Parameters: N (int), K (int), group_sizes (List[int]), groups (List[List[int]])
   - Return type: int

2. Variable Declarations:
   - A: List[int], initially an empty list
   - n: int, initialized to 0

3. Logic Flow:
   1. Initialize A as a list of zeros with length N.
      - For i from 0 to N-1, append 0 to A.
   2. For i from 0 to K-1, execute the following:
      - d = group_sizes[i]
      - AA = groups[i]
      - For j from 0 to d-1, execute the following:
        - Set A[AA[j] - 1] to 1.
   3. Initialize n to 0.
   4. For i from 0 to N-1, execute the following:
      - If A[i] is equal to 0, increment n by 1.
   5. Return n.

4. Control Structures:
   - For loops: Iterate over ranges for initializing A and modifying it based on input groups.
   - If condition: Check if an element in A is 0 to count unmarked positions.

5. Input/Output Operations:
   - Inputs: N (number of elements), K (number of groups), group_sizes (list of group sizes), groups (list of lists containing group elements)
   - Output: The number of unmarked positions in A.

6. Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
   - None.
