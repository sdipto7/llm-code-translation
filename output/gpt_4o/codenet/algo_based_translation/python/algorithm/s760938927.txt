Algorithm:

1. Declare and initialize variables:
   - h, w, ka: integers obtained from user input, representing the height and width of the matrix and the target count of '#' respectively.
   - mat: a list of lists containing strings, representing the matrix, with input obtained line-by-line for each row.
   - ans: integer initialized to 0, used to count the number of valid configurations.

2. Iterate over all possible combinations of row and column selections:
   - For i from 0 to (2**(h+w) - 1):
     a. Convert i to a binary string with length (h+w), padded with leading zeros if necessary (variable 'b').
     b. Split 'b' into two parts: 
        - rs: first h characters representing row selections.
        - cs: remaining characters representing column selections.

3. Calculate the number of '#' that remain in the matrix after applying the current selections:
   - Initialize ct to 0, which counts the number of '#' that are not removed.
   - For each row index l from 0 to h-1:
     a. For each column index k from 0 to w-1:
        i. If mat[l][k] is '#' and rs[l] is '0' and cs[k] is '0', increment ct by 1.

4. Check if the current configuration matches the target count:
   - If ct is equal to ka, increment ans by 1.

5. Output the final count:
   - Print the value of ans.
