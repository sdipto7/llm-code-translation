Function Signature:
- None (code is executed in the global scope)

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `a`: integer
- `b`: integer

Logic Flow:
1. Read a line of input from the user and split it into two parts.
2. Convert the two parts into integers and assign them to variables `a` and `b`.

Control Structures:
- Conditional:
  - If `a` is less than or equal to 8 and `b` is less than or equal to 8, then:
    - Print "Yay!"
  - Else:
    - Print ":("

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read a line of space-separated integers from standard input.
- Output: Print either "Yay!" or ":(" based on the condition.

Required Libraries:
