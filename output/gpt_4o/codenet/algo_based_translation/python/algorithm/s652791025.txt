- Function Signature:
  - `determine_suffix(s: str) -> None`

- Variable Declarations:
  - `n: int`

- Logic Flow:
  1. Receive input `s` as a string.
  2. Convert `s` to an integer `n` by extracting the last character of `s` and converting it to an integer.
  3. Conditional Branching:
     - If `n` is equal to 2, 4, 5, 7, or 9, output "hon".
     - Else if `n` is equal to 0, 1, 6, or 8, output "pon".
     - Otherwise, output "bon".

- Control Structures:
  - Conditional Statements:
    - `if n == 2 or n == 4 or n == 5 or n == 7 or n == 9`
    - `elif n == 0 or n == 1 or n == 6 or n == 8`
    - `else`

- Input/Output Operations:
  - Input: Read a string from standard input representing a number.
  - Output: Print a string to standard output based on the value of `n`.

- Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
  - None
