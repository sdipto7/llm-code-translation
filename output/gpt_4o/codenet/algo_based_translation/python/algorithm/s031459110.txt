Algorithm: Calculate Minimum Swaps to Order Characters

1. Function Signature:
   - Function Name: calculate_minimum_swaps
   - Parameters: None
   - Return Type: int

2. Variable Declarations:
   - N: int (stores the number of characters)
   - c: str (stores the input string of characters)
   - num_w: int (stores the count of 'W' characters in the string)
   - num_r: int (stores the count of 'R' characters in the string)
   - comp: str (stores the target ordered string with 'R' first, followed by 'W')
   - ans: int (stores the number of swaps needed)

3. Execution Logic:
   a. Read an integer input and assign it to N.
   b. Read a string input and assign it to c.
   c. Calculate the number of 'W' characters in c and assign to num_w.
   d. Calculate num_r as the difference between N and num_w.
   e. Construct the target ordered string comp by concatenating 'R' repeated num_r times and 'W' repeated num_w times.
   f. Initialize ans to 0.
   g. Loop for each index i from 0 to num_r - 1:
      i. If c[i] is not equal to comp[i], increment ans by 1.
   h. Calculate the minimum of num_w, num_r, and ans, and assign it back to ans.

4. Output:
   a. Print the value of ans.

5. Libraries/Modules:
   - No external libraries or modules are required.
