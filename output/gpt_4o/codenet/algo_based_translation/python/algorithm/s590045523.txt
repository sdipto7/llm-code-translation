Function Signature:
- function count_valid_triangles(N: int, L: List[int]) -> int

Variable Declarations:
- ans: int, initialized to 0

Logic Flow:
1. Read an integer input and assign it to N.
2. Read a list of integers input, map them to integers, and assign to L.
3. Initialize ans to 0.
4. Execute a nested loop:
   - Outer loop variable i ranges from 0 to N-2 (inclusive).
   - Middle loop variable j ranges from i+1 to N-1 (inclusive).
   - Inner loop variable k ranges from j+1 to N (exclusive).
5. In each iteration of the innermost loop:
   - Assign L[i] to variable a.
   - Assign L[j] to variable b.
   - Assign L[k] to variable c.
   - Check if a, b, or c are equal:
     - If any two of a, b, and c are equal, continue to next iteration.
   - Check if a, b, and c can form a triangle:
     - If a + b > c, b + c > a, and c + a > b, increment ans by 1.
6. After all iterations, return ans.

Control Structures:
- Three nested for loops with specific range conditions.
- Two conditional statements to skip iterations or increment ans.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Integer N and list of integers L via standard input.
- Output: Integer ans via standard output.

Required Libraries:
- None
