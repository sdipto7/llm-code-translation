```
Function Signature:
    def compute_min_cost(n: int, m: int, x: int, a: List[int]) -> int

Variable Declarations:
    n: int
    m: int
    x: int
    a: List[int]
    ans: int
    i: int

Library Dependencies:
    from bisect import bisect

Execution Logic:
1. Initialize variables n, m, x by reading a line of input and splitting the values, converting each to an integer.
2. Initialize list a by reading a line of input, splitting the values, and converting each to an integer.
3. Set ans to 0.
4. Use the bisect function from the bisect module to find the insertion point i for x in the sorted list a.
5. Calculate the minimum of the lengths of the two sublists a[:i] and a[i:].
6. Return the calculated minimum value as the result.
