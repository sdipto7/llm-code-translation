```
Function Signature:
- Function: calculate_minimum_cost
- Parameters: None
- Return Type: int

Algorithm:
1. Input Handling:
   - Read a single line of input from the user.
   - Parse the input using `split()` to separate the values based on spaces.
   - Use `map(int, input().split())` to convert the input values into integers and assign them to variables `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. Variable Declarations:
   - `n`: int (the number of items)
   - `a`: int (the cost per item)
   - `b`: int (the constant cost)

3. Computation:
   - Calculate the total cost if each item is bought individually: `individual_cost = n * a`.
   - Compare `individual_cost` with the constant cost `b`.
   - Use the `min()` function to determine the smaller cost between `individual_cost` and `b`.

4. Output:
   - Return the result of the `min()` function which is the minimum of the two computed costs.
