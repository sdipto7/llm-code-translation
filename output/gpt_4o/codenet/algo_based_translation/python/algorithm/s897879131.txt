Function Signature:
    def count_combinations(R: int, G: int, B: int, N: int) -> int

Variable Declarations:
    score: int

Algorithm:
    1. Initialize score to 0
    2. Loop i from 0 to N // R inclusive:
        a. Calculate the maximum value of j as (N - i * R) // G
        b. Loop j from 0 to the maximum value calculated in step 2a inclusive:
            i. Calculate remaining as N - i * R - j * G
            ii. Check if remaining is non-negative and divisible by B:
                - If true, increment score by 1
    3. Return score

Input/Output:
    - Input: None (function parameters are used instead of input())
    - Output: Returns an integer representing the number of valid combinations
