Function Signature:
    def transform_string(N: int, K: int, S: str) -> str

Algorithm:
1. Parse two integers N and K from input.
2. Parse a string S from input and convert it to a list of characters.
3. Determine the character at the (K-1)th index in the list S:
   a. If the character is "A", replace it with "a".
   b. Else if the character is "B", replace it with "b".
   c. Else, replace it with "c".
4. Join the list S back into a single string.
5. Return the resulting string.
6. Print the resulting string.
