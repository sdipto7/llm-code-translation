- Function signature: None (code is executed in the main block)
- Required libraries: None
- Variable declarations:
  - `n`: int
  - `h`: int
  - `m`: int
  - `s`: int
- Input operation:
  - Read an integer from standard input and assign it to `n`
- Logic flow:
  1. Calculate `h` as the integer division of `n` by 3600
  2. Update `n` to the remainder of `n` divided by 3600
  3. Calculate `m` as the integer division of `n` by 60
  4. Update `n` to the remainder of `n` divided by 60
  5. Assign `s` the value of `n` (which is now the remaining seconds)
- Output operation: Print the string concatenation of `h`, `m`, and `s` separated by colons `:`
