- Function signature: None (code is executed in a script-like manner)
- Input: Two integers, N (number of items) and T (total time allowed)
- Input: List L of N sublists, each containing two integers: time and value of the item

- Variable Declarations:
  - N, T: integers
  - L: list of lists of integers
  - dp: list of lists of integers, dimensions (N+1) x T, initialized to zero
  - used: list of integers, initially empty
  - B: integer, initialized to the value of dp[N][T-1]
  - j: integer, initialized to T-1
  - ans: integer
  - c: integer, initialized to zero

- Execution Flow:
  1. Read two integers from input and assign to N and T
  2. Read N lines of input, each containing two integers, and store in list L
  3. Initialize a 2D list dp with dimensions (N+1) x T, filled with zeros
  4. For each item i from 0 to N-1:
     - For each time j from 0 to T-1:
       - If j is less than L[i][0], set dp[i+1][j] to dp[i][j]
       - Otherwise, set dp[i+1][j] to the maximum of dp[i][j] and dp[i][j-L[i][0]] + L[i][1]
  5. Initialize B to dp[N][T-1] and j to T-1
  6. For each item i from N-1 to 0:
     - If B equals dp[i][j], continue to next iteration
     - Subtract L[i][1] from B
     - Append i to the list used
     - Subtract L[i][0] from j
  7. Initialize ans to dp[N][T-1]
  8. For each item i from 0 to N-1:
     - If i is in used, continue to next iteration
     - Update c to the maximum of current c and L[i][1]
  9. Print the sum of ans and c
