Function Signature:
- Function: `multiply_integers_and_decimal`
- Parameters: None
- Return Type: int

Algorithm:
1. Input Operations:
   - Read a single line of input and split it into two parts `A` and `B` using space as the delimiter.
   - `A` will be a string representing an integer.
   - `B` will be a string representing a decimal number.

2. Data Processing:
   - Convert `A` to an integer.
   - Remove the period from `B` and convert it to an integer.

3. Arithmetic Operations:
   - Multiply the integer value of `A` by the integer value of `B`.
   - Perform integer division of the result by 100.

4. Output Operations:
   - Print the resulting value from the arithmetic operations.

Variable Declarations:
- `A`: int
- `B`: int (after removing the decimal point and converting)
- `result`: int

Dependencies:
- None
