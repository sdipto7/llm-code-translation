Function Signature:
    def calculate_harmonic_mean(n: int, a: List[int]) -> float

Variable Declarations:
    below: float

Execution Logic:
    1. Initialize 'below' as 0 (float).
    2. Loop over each integer 'i' from 0 to 'n-1' (inclusive):
        a. Increment 'below' by the reciprocal of 'a[i]'.
    3. Calculate the harmonic mean as the reciprocal of 'below'.
    4. Return the calculated harmonic mean.

Input/Output Operations:
    - Input: Read an integer 'n' from standard input.
    - Input: Read a list 'a' of 'n' integers from standard input.
    - Output: Print the harmonic mean calculated as per the logic.

Required Libraries:
    - List from typing module for type hinting.
