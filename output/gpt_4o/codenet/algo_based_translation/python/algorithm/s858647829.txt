1. Function Signature:
   - Function: check_divisibility
   - Parameters: a (int), b (int)
   - Return Type: str

2. Variable Declaration:
   - a: int
   - b: int
   - result: str

3. Logic Flow:
   - Read two integers from input, a and b.
   - Check divisibility:
     - If `a` is divisible by 3 (`a % 3 == 0`), set `result` to 'Possible'.
     - Else if `b` is divisible by 3 (`b % 3 == 0`), set `result` to 'Possible'.
     - Else if the sum of `a` and `b` is divisible by 3 (`(a + b) % 3 == 0`), set `result` to 'Possible'.
     - Else, set `result` to 'Impossible'.

4. Control Structures:
   - Conditionals: 
     - `if` condition to check divisibility by 3 for `a`.
     - `elif` condition to check divisibility by 3 for `b`.
     - `elif` condition to check divisibility by 3 for the sum of `a` and `b`.
     - `else` condition if none of the above conditions are met.

5. Input/Output Operations:
   - Input: Read a line of input, split by whitespace, and convert to integers `a` and `b`.
   - Output: Print `result`.

6. Required Libraries:
   - No external libraries or modules are required.
