Function Signature:
- Function Name: calculate_min_value
- Parameters: 
  - N: integer
  - A: integer
  - B: integer
- Return Type: integer

Variable Declarations:
- ans: integer

Logic Flow:
1. Read three integers N, A, and B from input.
2. Compute the integer division of N by the sum of A and B, i.e., N // (A + B).
3. Multiply the result of the division by A to calculate the first part of the answer.
4. Compute the modulus of N by the sum of A and B, i.e., N % (A + B).
5. Determine the minimum value between A and the result from step 4.
6. Add the value from step 5 to the result from step 3 to get the final answer.
7. Return the value of the answer.

Control Structures:
- Conditional:
  - Use the min function to choose the smaller value between A and N % (A + B).

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read three integers from standard input.
- Output: Print the result.

Required Libraries:
- None
