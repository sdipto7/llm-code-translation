Algorithm:

- Function signature: `def calculate_remainder(N: int, K: int) -> int`
- Variable declaration: `N` and `K` are both integers.
- Input operation:
  - Read a line of input.
  - Split the input string by spaces.
  - Convert the split strings to integers `N` and `K`.
- Control structure:
  - Conditional statement: `if N % K == 0`
    - If the condition is true, output `0`.
    - Otherwise, output `1`.
- Output operation:
  - Print the result based on the conditional check.
- No additional libraries, modules, or dependencies are required.
