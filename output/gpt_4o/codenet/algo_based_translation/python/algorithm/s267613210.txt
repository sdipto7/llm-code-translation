```
1. Import the `sys` module to use `sys.stdin.readline` for input operations.

2. Define a function `main()` with no parameters and no return value:
   a. Declare variables `K` and `N`:
      - `K` is an integer representing the circumference of a circle.
      - `N` is an integer representing the number of points on the circle.
   b. Read input using `input_nums()` to initialize `K` and `N`.
   c. Declare a list `A` of integers representing the positions of points on the circle.
   d. Read input using `input_nums()` to initialize list `A`.

3. Declare an empty list `dist` to hold distances between consecutive points.

4. Use a `for` loop to iterate over indices from 0 to `len(A) - 2`:
   a. For each index `i`, calculate the distance between consecutive points `A[i+1]` and `A[i]`.
   b. Append the calculated distance to the list `dist`.

5. Calculate the circular distance from the last point to the first point using the formula `K + A[0] - A[-1]`.
6. Append this circular distance to the list `dist`.

7. Calculate the maximum value `maxv` in the list `dist`.

8. Calculate the sum of all distances in `dist`.

9. Subtract `maxv` from the sum of distances.

10. Print the result.

11. Call the `main()` function if the script is executed as the main module.
