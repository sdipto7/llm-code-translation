Function Signature:
    function can_catch_up(a: int, v: int, b: int, w: int, t: int) -> str

Variable Declarations:
    a: int
    v: int
    b: int
    w: int
    t: int

Logic Flow:
1. Receive inputs for a, v, b, w, and t:
   - a and v as integers from the first input split by space
   - b and w as integers from the second input split by space
   - t as an integer from the third input

2. Check if starting positions a and b are the same:
   - If a equals b, return 'YES'

3. If not, check if velocity v is less than or equal to velocity w:
   - If v is less than or equal to w, return 'NO'

4. If velocities are such that v is greater than w:
   - Calculate the time required to catch up as abs(a - b) / (v - w)
   - Compare calculated time with t:
     - If t is less than the calculated time, return 'NO'
     - Otherwise, return 'YES'

Control Structures:
- Conditional statements: if-elif-else for checking positions and velocities

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Reading integers from the user input
- Output: Printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on conditions

Required Libraries:
- No external libraries or modules are required
