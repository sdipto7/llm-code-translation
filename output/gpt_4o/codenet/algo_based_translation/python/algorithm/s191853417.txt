- Function signature:
  - `def calculate_remaining_score(input_string: str) -> int`

- Variable declarations:
  - `a: int`
  - `b: int`
  - `c: int`
  - `d: int`
  - `e: int`

- Logic flow:
  1. Receive a string of space-separated integers as input.
  2. Split the input string into individual string components.
  3. Convert each string component to an integer using `map`.
  4. Assign each converted integer to variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`.
  5. Calculate the remaining score by subtracting the sum of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` from 15.
  6. Return the calculated remaining score.

- Control structures:
  - There are no loops or conditionals in the logic.

- Input/Output operations:
  - Input: A single string of space-separated integers is expected.
  - Output: An integer representing the remaining score after calculation.

- Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
  - No external libraries or modules are required.
