- Function: main() -> None
- Variables:
  - n: int
  - p: List[int]
  - p_copy: List[int]
  - count: int
- Input Operations:
  - Read integer from input and assign to n
  - Read line of input, split by spaces, convert each to integer, and assign list to p
  - Assign a copy of p to p_copy
- Data Processing and Logic:
  - Sort list p in ascending order
  - Initialize count to 0
- Loop and Control Structures:
  - For variable i from 0 to n-1:
    - If p[i] is not equal to p_copy[i]:
      - Increment count by 1
- Conditional Output:
  - If count is equal to 0 or count is equal to 2:
    - Output "YES"
  - Else:
    - Output "NO"
- No external libraries, modules, or dependencies are required
