- Function Signature:
  - Function Name: `calculate_possible_value`
  - Parameters: `A` (int), `B` (int)
  - Return Type: `int`

- Variable Declarations:
  - `min` (int): initialized as `B * 10`
  - `max` (int): initialized as `(B + 1) * 10 - 1`
  - `ans` (int): initialized as `-1`

- Logic Flow:
  1. Initialize `min` as the product of `B` and `10`.
  2. Initialize `max` as the product of `B+1` and `10`, then subtract `1`.
  3. Initialize `ans` as `-1`.
  4. Begin a loop with `i` starting from `min` to `max` (inclusive).
     - Condition: If `int(i * 0.08)` is equal to `A`, then:
       - Assign `i` to `ans`.
       - Break the loop.
  5. After the loop concludes, return the value of `ans`.

- Input/Output Operations:
  - Input: Read a single line of input and split it into two integers, `A` and `B`.
  - Output: Print the value of `ans`.

- Required Libraries:
  - None
