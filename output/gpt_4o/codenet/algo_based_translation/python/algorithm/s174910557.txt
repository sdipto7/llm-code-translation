```
- Function Signature:
  - `def count_distinct_adjacent_segments(s: str) -> int`

- Variable Declarations:
  - `N: int` - the length of the string (input is read but not used in logic)
  - `S: str` - the input string
  - `ans: int` - initialized to 1, used to count distinct adjacent segments
  - `tmp: str` - initialized to the first character of `S`, used to track the current segment character
  - `s: str` - iterator variable for characters in `S`

- Logic Flow:
  1. Read input `N` as an integer.
  2. Read input `S` as a string.
  3. Initialize `ans` to 1 to account for the first segment.
  4. Set `tmp` to the first character of `S`.
  5. Iterate over each character `s` in `S`:
     - If `s` is not equal to `tmp`:
       - Increment `ans` by 1.
       - Update `tmp` to `s`.
  6. Output the value of `ans`.

- Control Structures:
  - Loop: `for s in S` iterates over each character in the string `S`.
  - Conditional: `if s != tmp` checks if the current character `s` is different from `tmp`.

- Input/Output Operations:
  - Input: Read an integer from the standard input for `N`.
  - Input: Read a string from the standard input for `S`.
  - Output: Print the integer `ans`.

- Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
  - None
