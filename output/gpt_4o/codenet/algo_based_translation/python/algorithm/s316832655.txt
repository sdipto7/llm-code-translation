```
Function Signature:
- calculate_triangle_area(inputs: str) -> int

Algorithm:
1. Input/Output Operations:
   - Read a single input string, `inputs`, which contains three space-separated integers.

2. Variable Declarations and Data Types:
   - Declare `a`, `b`, `c` as integers.

3. Data Processing Logic:
   - Use `map` to convert the input string into three integers and assign them to `a`, `b`, and `c`.

4. Logic Flow:
   - Calculate the area of a triangle using the formula: `(a * b) / 2`.
   - Convert the result to an integer.

5. Output:
   - Return the calculated area as an integer.

Dependencies:
- None
