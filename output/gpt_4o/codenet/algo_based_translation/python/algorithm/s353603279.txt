Function Signature:
    def calculate_total_reward(x: int) -> int

Variable Declarations:
    x: int
    h: int
    a: int
    y: int

Logic Flow:
    1. Receive an integer input x from the user.
    2. Calculate the number of complete 500 units in x and store in h.
        - h = x // 500
    3. Calculate the remaining amount after extracting 500 units and determine the number of complete 5 units in that remainder, storing the result in a.
        - a = (x % 500) // 5
    4. Compute the total reward y based on:
        - The number of 500 units (h) each contributing 1000 to the reward.
        - The number of 5 units (a) each contributing 5 to the reward.
        - y = h * 1000 + a * 5
    5. Return the calculated reward y.

Input/Output Operations:
    - Input: An integer value x is taken from the user.
    - Output: The calculated reward y is printed to the console.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
    - No external libraries or modules are required.
