Algorithm:

1. Input an integer N from the user.
2. Declare a list A of integers and populate it by taking input from the user, splitting the input string by spaces, and converting each element to an integer.
3. Declare a list B of integers and populate it by taking input from the user, splitting the input string by spaces, and converting each element to an integer.
4. Declare an integer variable `ans` and initialize it to 0.
5. Loop from i = 0 to i < N:
   a. Calculate the minimum of A[i] and B[i], store it in variable `d`.
   b. Increment `ans` by `d`.
   c. Subtract `d` from A[i].
   d. Subtract `d` from B[i].
   e. Calculate the minimum of A[i + 1] and B[i], store it in variable `d`.
   f. Increment `ans` by `d`.
   g. Subtract `d` from A[i + 1].
   h. Subtract `d` from B[i].
6. Output the value of `ans`.
