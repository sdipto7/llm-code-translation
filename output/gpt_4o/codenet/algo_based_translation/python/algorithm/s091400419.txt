Function Signature:
- Function: `find_maximum_expression_result(a: int, b: int) -> int`

Algorithm:
1. Variable Declarations:
   - `a`: integer
   - `b`: integer
   - `lst`: list of integers

2. Input Operations:
   - Read a single line of input as a string.
   - Split the input string into two substrings using space as the delimiter.
   - Convert the substrings into integers and assign them to `a` and `b`.

3. Data Processing Logic:
   - Calculate the sum of `a` and `b`, and store it in `lst[0]`.
   - Calculate the difference (`a - b`), and store it in `lst[1]`.
   - Calculate the product of `a` and `b`, and store it in `lst[2]`.

4. Output Operations:
   - Compute the maximum value from the list `lst`.
   - Print the maximum value.

5. Return:
   - The function returns the maximum value calculated from the list `lst`.
