Algorithm:
1. Input Reading:
   - Read a single line of input and split it into two integers `n` and `k`.

2. Variable Declarations:
   - `n: int` - the number of elements in the list.
   - `k: int` - the number of smallest elements to sum.
   - `li: List[int]` - a list of integers of length `n`.
   - `tmp: List[int]` - a list that will store the first `k` smallest integers from `li`.

3. Input Parsing:
   - Read a single line of input and split it into `n` integers.
   - Assign this list of integers to `li`.

4. Sorting:
   - Sort the list `li` in ascending order.

5. Selection:
   - Select the first `k` elements from the sorted list `li` and assign them to `tmp`.

6. Sum Calculation:
   - Calculate the sum of the integers in the list `tmp`.

7. Output:
   - Print the calculated sum.
