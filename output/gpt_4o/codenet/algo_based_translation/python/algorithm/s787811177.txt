Algorithm:

1. Define a function `compute_score_difference(n: int, rounds: List[List[int]]) -> int`.

2. Declare variables:
   - `ls: List[List[int]]` to store the list of rounds.

3. Initialize `ls` with `rounds` which is a list of lists, each containing two integers.

4. Sort `ls` in descending order based on the sum of each sub-list using the sorting key `lambda x: sum(x)`.

5. Declare variables `taka: int` and `aoki: int` and initialize both to 0 to store the scores of two players.

6. Iterate over the sorted list `ls` using a loop with index `i` ranging from 0 to the length of `ls`:
   - If `i` is even, add `ls[i][0]` to `taka`.
   - If `i` is odd, add `ls[i][1]` to `aoki`.

7. Calculate the difference between `taka` and `aoki` scores.

8. Return the result of `taka - aoki`.
