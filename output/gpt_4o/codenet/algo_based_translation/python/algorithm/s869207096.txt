Algorithm to count distinct adjacent characters in a string:

1. Define a function `count_distinct_adjacent_characters` with parameters:
   - `n: int` (length of the string)
   - `s: str` (input string)
   - Returns: `int` (count of distinct adjacent character groups)

2. Declare variable `cnt: int` and initialize it to 1.

3. Loop through integer `i` from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive):
   - If `s[i]` is equal to `s[i+1]`, then continue to the next iteration.
   - Else, increment `cnt` by 1.

4. Return `cnt`.

5. Main execution flow:
   - Read an integer input `n`.
   - Read a string input `s`.
   - Call the function `count_distinct_adjacent_characters(n, s)`.
   - Print the returned result.
