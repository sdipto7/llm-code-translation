Algorithm:
1. Declare a function named `calculate_total_value` with no parameters and a return type of `None`.
2. Declare an integer variable `n` to store the number of input lines.
3. Read an integer from input and assign it to `n`.
4. Declare a float variable `res` and initialize it to 0.0 to accumulate the result.
5. Start a for loop that iterates `n` times:
   a. Read a line of input, split it into two parts, and assign the first part to `x` and the second part to `u`.
   b. If `u` is equal to the string "BTC":
      i. Convert `x` to a float, multiply it by 380000, and add the result to `res`.
   c. Else:
      i. Convert `x` to an integer and add it to `res`.
6. Print the final value of `res`.
