Function Signature:
- Function: `calculate_remaining_area(H: int, W: int, h: int, w: int) -> int`

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- `H` and `W`: integers representing the dimensions of a larger rectangle.
- `h` and `w`: integers representing the dimensions of a smaller rectangle that overlaps with the larger rectangle.
- `ans`: integer representing the remaining area of the larger rectangle after accounting for the overlapping area.

Logic Flow:
1. Read two integers from input, representing the dimensions `H` (height) and `W` (width) of the larger rectangle.
2. Read two more integers from input, representing the dimensions `h` (height) and `w` (width) of the smaller rectangle.
3. Calculate the area of the larger rectangle as `H * W`.
4. Calculate the area of the overlapping region: `h * W + w * H - h * w`.
5. Subtract the area of the overlapping region from the area of the larger rectangle to get the remaining area.
6. Assign the result to the variable `ans`.
7. Output the value of `ans`.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read four integers from standard input.
- Output: Print the calculated remaining area as an integer.

No control structures like loops or conditionals are used in this algorithm.

No external libraries, modules, or dependencies are required.
