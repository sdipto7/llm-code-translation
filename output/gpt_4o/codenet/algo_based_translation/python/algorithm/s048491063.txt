Function: main()
    Input: None
    Output: None

    Step 1: Read integers N, M, Q from input
        - N: int
        - M: int
        - Q: int

    Step 2: Initialize 2D list `train` with dimensions N x N, filled with 0
        - train: List[List[int]]

    Step 3: Loop M times to read and process train data
        - For each iteration:
            - Read integers l, r from input
            - Increment train[l-1][r-1] by 1

    Step 4: Initialize 2D list `accum` with one row of N+1 zeros
        - accum: List[List[int]]

    Step 5: Loop through each index i from 0 to N-1
        - Initialize list `temp` with one zero
        - Initialize integer `v` to 0
        - For each index j from 0 to N-1:
            - Add train[i][j] to `v`
            - Append accum[-1][j+1] + v to `temp`
        - Append `temp` to `accum`

    Step 6: Loop Q times to process and output query results
        - For each iteration:
            - Read integers p, q from input
            - Calculate integer `v` using:
                v = accum[q][q] - accum[p-1][q] - accum[q][p-1] + accum[p-1][p-1]
            - Output `v`
