- Function Signature: calculate_attacks(h: int, a: int) -> int
- Variable Declarations:
  - ans: int
  - ama: int
- Input/Output Operations:
  - Read two integers from input, h and a.
  - Output the result of the calculation as an integer.
- Complete Logic Flow:
  1. Read and parse two integers from input, assigning them to variables `h` and `a`.
  2. Calculate `ans` as the integer division of `h` by `a`.
  3. Calculate `ama` as the remainder of the division of `h` by `a`.
  4. If `ama` is not equal to 0, increment `ans` by 1.
  5. Output the value of `ans`.
- Control Structures:
  - Conditional: `if ama != 0`
- No additional libraries, modules, or dependencies required.
