```plaintext
Function: main()
  Input:
    - Read an integer N from input, where N: int
    - Read a list of integers from input, split by space, convert to int, and store in list A, where A: List[int]
  Variables:
    - ans: int, initialized to the absolute value of the last element in A
    - A: List[int], prepend 0 and append 0 to the list
    - diff: List[int], initialized with N zeros
  Logic:
    - For loop iterating over i from 1 to N (inclusive):
      - Compute dif as the sum of absolute differences:
        - abs(A[i] - A[i-1])
        - abs(A[i] - A[i+1])
        - Subtract abs(A[i-1] - A[i+1])
      - Increment ans by abs(A[i] - A[i-1])
      - Store the value of dif in diff at index i-1
    - For loop iterating over i from 0 to N-1 (inclusive):
      - Output the result of ans minus diff[i]
```
