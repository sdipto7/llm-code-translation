Algorithm main():
    Input: None
    Output: Prints a space-separated string of integers

    Import libraries:
        java.util.Scanner
        java.util.Map
        java.util.HashMap
        java.util.Map.Entry
        java.util.stream.Collectors

    Declare sc as Scanner object initialized with System.in
    Declare N as integer
    Declare map as HashMap with key and value as Integer

    Read an integer from sc and assign to N

    For each integer i from 1 to N (inclusive):
        Read an integer from sc
        Insert key-value pair (i, read integer) into map

    Create a stream from map entry set
    Sort the stream by entry value using Entry.comparingByValue()
    Map each entry in the sorted stream to its key
    Convert each key to a string
    Collect the mapped keys into a list
    Join the list elements into a single string with space as separator
    Print the resulting string
