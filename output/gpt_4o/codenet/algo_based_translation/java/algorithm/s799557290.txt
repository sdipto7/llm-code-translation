Algorithm Main
    Input: None
    Output: None

    Declare integer a
    Declare integer b
    Declare boolean array ju of size 100001
    Declare integer array pe of size 100001
    Declare integer wa, initialize to 0
    Declare integer ac, initialize to 0

    Create a Scanner object sc to read input

    Read integer input and assign to a
    Read integer input and assign to b

    For i from 0 to b-1 do
        Read integer input and assign to n
        Read string input and assign to res

        If res is equal to "WA" and ju[n-1] is not true then
            Increment pe[n-1] by 1
        End If

        If res is equal to "AC" then
            Set ju[n-1] to true
        End If
    End For

    For i from 0 to a-1 do
        If ju[i] is true then
            Increment ac by 1
            Increment wa by pe[i]
        End If
    End For

    Print ac and wa as concatenated string with a space separator
