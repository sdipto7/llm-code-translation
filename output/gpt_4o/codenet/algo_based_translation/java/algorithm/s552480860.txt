Function: main
Parameters: None
Return Type: void

1. Import the required library: java.util.Scanner

2. Declare an object 'sc' of type Scanner initialized with System.in for reading input.

3. Read an integer from input and store it in variable 'h1' (data type: int).

4. Read an integer from input and store it in variable 'm1' (data type: int).

5. Read an integer from input and store it in variable 'h2' (data type: int).

6. Read an integer from input and store it in variable 'm2' (data type: int).

7. Read an integer from input and store it in variable 'k' (data type: int).

8. Calculate 't1' as the sum of 'h1' multiplied by 60 and 'm1'. Store the result in 't1' (data type: int).

9. Calculate 't2' as the sum of 'h2' multiplied by 60 and 'm2'. Store the result in 't2' (data type: int).

10. Calculate the result as 't2' minus 't1' minus 'k'.
