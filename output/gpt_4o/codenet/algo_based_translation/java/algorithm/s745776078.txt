1. Function Signature:
   - `main` function with no parameters and no return type

2. Variable Declarations:
   - `Scanner in` is of type `Scanner` (used for input)
   - `PrintWriter out` is of type `PrintWriter` (used for output)
   - `int n` is an integer (represents the number of rows in matrix A)
   - `int m` is an integer (represents the number of columns in matrix A and length of vector b)
   - `int[][] A` is a 2D integer array with dimensions `n x m` (matrix A)
   - `int[] b` is a 1D integer array with length `m` (vector b)

3. Input Operations:
   - Read integers `n` and `m` from standard input
   - Initialize 2D array `A` with dimensions `n x m`
   - Initialize 1D array `b` with length `m`
   - Fill matrix `A` with integers from input:
     - For each `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
       - For each `j` from 0 to `m-1`:
         - Read integer and assign to `A[i][j]`
   - Fill vector `b` with integers from input:
     - For each `i` from 0 to `m-1`:
       - Read integer and assign to `b[i]`

4. Processing Logic:
   - For each `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - Initialize integer `c` to 0 (used to store the dot product result)
     - For each `j` from 0 to `m-1`:
       - Compute product `A[i][j] * b[j]` and add to `c`
     - Output `c` using `PrintWriter out`

5. Output Operations:
   - Print each computed integer result `c` to standard output
   - Use `out.flush()` to ensure all output is written
