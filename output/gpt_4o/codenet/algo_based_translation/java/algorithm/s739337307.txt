```
Function Signature:
- Function: main
- Parameters: None
- Return Type: void

Variable Declarations:
- n (int)
- m (int)
- map (HashMap<Integer, Integer>)
- countAc (int)
- countWaAll (int)
- question (int)
- waOrAc (String)
- countWa (int)

Execution Flow:
1. Initialize Scanner to read input.
2. Read integer n from input.
3. Read integer m from input.
4. Initialize map as a HashMap<Integer, Integer>.
5. Initialize countAc to 0.
6. Initialize countWaAll to 0.
7. Loop from 0 to m-1 (inclusive):
   a. Read an integer question from input.
   b. Read a string waOrAc from input.
   c. If map does not contain question as a key:
      i. If waOrAc equals "WA", insert key question with value 1 into map.
      ii. Else, insert key question with value -1 into map and increment countAc by 1.
   d. Else (map contains question as a key):
      i. Retrieve the value countWa associated with key question from map.
      ii. If countWa is negative, do nothing.
      iii. Else:
         - If waOrAc equals "WA", replace map entry for key question with value countWa + 1.
         - Else, replace map entry for key question with value -countWa, increment countAc by 1, and increment countWaAll by countWa.
8. Print countAc and countWaAll separated by a space.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read integers n and m, followed by m pairs of (integer, string) using Scanner.
- Output: Print the values of countAc and countWaAll.

Dependencies:
- java.util.*, java.math.*
