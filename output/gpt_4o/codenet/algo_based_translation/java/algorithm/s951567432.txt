- Function Signature:
  - `main(args: String[]): void`

- Variable Declarations:
  - `count: int`
  - `total: int`
  - `ix: int`

- Logic Flow:
  1. Initialize `count` by reading an integer from standard input using `Scanner`.
  2. Initialize `total` to `0`.
  3. Begin a for loop:
     - Start `ix` at `1`.
     - Continue the loop while `ix` is less than or equal to `count`.
     - Increment `ix` by `1` after each iteration.
  4. Within the loop, add the current value of `ix` to `total`.
  5. After the loop completes, output the value of `total` to standard output.

- Control Structures:
  - For loop with initialization (`ix = 1`), condition (`ix <= count`), and increment (`ix++`).

- Input/Output Operations:
  - Input: Read integer from standard input.
  - Output: Print integer to standard output.

- Required Libraries:
  - `java.util.Scanner` for reading input from standard input.
