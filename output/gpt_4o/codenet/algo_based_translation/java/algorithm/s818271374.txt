```
Algorithm Main
  Input: None
  Output: "Yes" or "No" printed to standard output

  Declare sc as Scanner initialized to read from standard input
  Declare N as integer, read next integer from sc
  Declare count1 as integer, initialize to 0
  Declare count2 as integer, initialize to 0

  For i from 0 to N-1 inclusive, do:
    Declare a as integer, read next integer from sc
    If a mod 4 equals 0, then:
      Increment count1 by 1
    Else if a mod 2 equals 0 and (a divided by 2) mod 2 equals 1, then:
      Increment count2 by 1

  If count1 is greater than or equal to N divided by 2, then:
    Print "Yes" to standard output
  Else if ((N divided by 2 minus count1) multiplied by 2 plus N mod 2) equals count2, then:
    Print "Yes" to standard output
  Else:
    Print "No" to standard output
