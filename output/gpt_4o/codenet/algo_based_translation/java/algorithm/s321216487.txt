Algorithm CheckKeyenceSubstring

Input: 
  A string S

Output:
  Prints "YES" if "keyence" can be formed by removing a contiguous substring from S, otherwise prints "NO".

Variables:
  sc : Scanner
  S : String
  begin : String
  end : String
  answer : String

Begin
  Create a Scanner object sc for input
  Read a string S from input using sc

  For each integer i from 0 to length of S - 1, inclusive, do
    For each integer j from 0 to length of S - 1, inclusive, do
      Set begin to the substring of S from index 0 to i (exclusive)
      Set end to the substring of S from index j to length of S (exclusive)
      Set answer to the concatenation of begin and end

      If answer is equal to "keyence", then
        Print "YES"
        Return

      Else if begin is equal to "keyence", then
        Print "YES"
        Return

      Else if end is equal to "keyence", then
        Print "YES"
        Return

  Print "NO"
End
