```
Dependencies:
- java.util.Scanner

Function Signature:
- main(String[] args): void

Variable Declarations:
- sc: Scanner
- a: int
- b: int
- c: int
- x: int
- res: int
- i: int
- j: int
- k: int
- total: int

Algorithm:
1. Initialize `sc` as a new instance of Scanner to read from the standard input.
2. Read an integer from input and assign it to `a`.
3. Read an integer from input and assign it to `b`.
4. Read an integer from input and assign it to `c`.
5. Read an integer from input and assign it to `x`.
6. Initialize `res` to 0.
7. For each integer `i` from 0 to `a` (inclusive):
   a. For each integer `j` from 0 to `b` (inclusive):
      i. For each integer `k` from 0 to `c` (inclusive):
         - Calculate `total` as `500 * i + 100 * j + 50 * k`.
         - If `total` equals `x`, increment `res` by 1.
8. Output the value of `res`.
