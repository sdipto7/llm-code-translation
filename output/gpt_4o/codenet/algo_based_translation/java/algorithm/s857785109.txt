Algorithm MainProgram
    Declare sc as Scanner object for reading input
    Declare n as Integer

    Read an integer from input into n

    If (n / 10) modulo 111 is equal to 0 Then
        Output "Yes"
    Else If (n modulo 1000) modulo 111 is equal to 0 Then
        Output "Yes"
    Else
        Output "No"
    End If
End Algorithm
