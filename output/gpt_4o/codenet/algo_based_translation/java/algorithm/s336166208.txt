    For integer i from 0 to 3 (inclusive):
        For integer j from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
            For integer k from 0 to 9 (inclusive):
                Set info[i][j][k] to 0

    Read integer 'n' from input
    
    For integer i from 0 to n-1 (inclusive):
        Read integer 'built' from input
        Read integer 'floor' from input
        Read integer 'room' from input
