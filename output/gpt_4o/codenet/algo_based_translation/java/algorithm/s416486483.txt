Algorithm

Function Signature:
- split(n: long, k: long) -> long
- solve(n: long, s: long) -> long

Variable Declarations:
- sum: long
- k: long
- a: long
- b: long
- dk: long
- nl: long
- sl: long
- s: Scanner

Logic Flow:
1. Define split function taking n and k as parameters:
   - Initialize sum to 0
   - While n is greater than 0:
     - Add n % k to sum
     - Divide n by k
   - Return sum

2. Define solve function taking n and s as parameters:
   - Initialize k to 2
   - Iterate while (k * k <= n) or (k < 100):
     - If split(n, k) equals s, return k
   - Iterate while k is less than or equal to n:
     - Set a to n divided by k
     - Set b to n modulo k
     - If (a + b - s) modulo a equals 0:
       - Set dk to (a + b - s) divided by a
       - If dk is greater than or equal to 0 and b - dk * a is greater than or equal to 0:
         - Return k + dk
     - Set k to n divided by a plus 1
   - If n equals s, return n + 1
   - Return -1

3. Main Execution:
   - Create Scanner object s for input
   - Read long values nl and sl from input
   - Call solve with nl and sl, print the result

Dependencies:
- java.util.Scanner
