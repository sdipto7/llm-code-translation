Algorithm CheckAdjacentEqualCharacters
  Input: String s
  Output: String "Bad" or "Good"

  Declare: int a = 0

  Step 1: Read input string s from standard input

  Step 2: Extract substrings
    Let s1 be the substring of s from index 0 to 1
    Let s2 be the substring of s from index 1 to 2
    Let s3 be the substring of s from index 2 to 3
    Let s4 be the substring of s from index 3 to 4

  Step 3: Compare adjacent substrings
    If s1 equals s2, set a = 1
    If s2 equals s3, set a = 1
    If s3 equals s4, set a = 1

  Step 4: Determine result based on value of a
    If a equals 1, output "Bad"
    Else, output "Good"

End Algorithm
