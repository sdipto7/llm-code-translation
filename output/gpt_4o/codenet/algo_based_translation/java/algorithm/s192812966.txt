```
- Import necessary library: java.util.Scanner

- Define main function with signature: public static void main(String[] args)

- Declare and initialize variables:
  - Scanner object: scanner
  - Integer: w, h, n
  - Integer arrays: x, y, a
  - Integers: xmax, xmin, ymax, ymin

- Read three integer inputs using scanner and assign them to w, h, and n respectively

- Initialize integer arrays x, y, and a with size n

- Initialize xmax with value of w, xmin with 0
- Initialize ymax with value of h, ymin with 0

- For loop from i = 0 to i < n:
  - Read integer inputs using scanner and assign them to x[i], y[i], and a[i]
  - Switch on value of a[i]:
    - Case 1:
      - Update xmin to be the maximum of xmin and x[i]
    - Case 2:
      - Update xmax to be the minimum of xmax and x[i]
    - Case 3:
      - Update ymin to be the maximum of ymin and y[i]
    - Case 4:
      - Update ymax to be the minimum of ymax and y[i]

- Calculate w as the maximum of (xmax - xmin) and 0
- Calculate h as the maximum of (ymax - ymin) and 0

- Output the product of w and h using System.out.println
