Algorithm Main
    Input: Two strings read from standard input
    Output: "Yes" if one string is a rotation of the other, otherwise "No"
    
    Function Rotate(str: StringBuilder) -> StringBuilder
        Declare len as integer
        Assign len = length of str
        Declare t as char
        Assign t = character at index 0 of str
        For i from 0 to len - 2 (inclusive)
            Set character at index i of str to character at index i + 1 of str
        End For
        Set character at index len - 1 of str to t
        Return str
    End Function

    Declare sc as Scanner
    Initialize sc with a new Scanner to read from standard input
    Declare s, t as StringBuilder
    Assign s = new StringBuilder initialized with the next input from sc
    Assign t = new StringBuilder initialized with the next input from sc
    Declare flag as boolean
    Set flag = false

    For i from 0 to length of s - 1 (inclusive)
        Assign s = Rotate(s)
        If string representation of t equals string representation of s
            Set flag = true
            Break the loop
        End If
    End For

    If flag is true
        Output "Yes"
    Else
        Output "No"
    End If
