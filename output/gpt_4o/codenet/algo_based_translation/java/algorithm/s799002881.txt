Function Signature: main() -> None

1. Import Libraries:
   - import java.io.BufferedReader
   - import java.io.IOException
   - import java.io.InputStreamReader
   - import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets

2. Variable Declarations:
   - reader: InputStreamReader (initialized with System.in and StandardCharsets.UTF_8)
   - in: BufferedReader (initialized with reader)
   - str: String[] (used for storing split input lines)
   - n: int (number of points to process)
   - d: double (radius of the circle, parsed from input)
   - cnt: int (counter for points inside or on the circle, initialized to 0)

3. Input Operations:
   - Read a line from standard input using BufferedReader and split it by spaces to populate the str array.
   - Parse the first element of str as an integer and assign it to n.
   - Parse the second element of str as an integer, convert it to double, and assign it to d.

4. Loop Through Points:
   - For i from 0 to n-1 (inclusive):
     a. Read a line from standard input using BufferedReader and split it by spaces to populate the str array.
     b. Parse the first element of str as an integer, convert it to double, and assign it to x.
     c. Parse the second element of str as an integer, convert it to double, and assign it to y.
     d. Calculate the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) using the formula: Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y).
     e. If the calculated distance is less than or equal to d, increment cnt by 1.

5. Output Operation:
   - Print the value of cnt to standard output.
