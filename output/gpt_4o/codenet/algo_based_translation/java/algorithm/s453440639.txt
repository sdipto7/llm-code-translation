```
Function signature:
    - main() : void

Variable declarations:
    - sc : Scanner
    - H : int
    - W : int
    - S : char[][]

Logic flow:
1. Initialize a Scanner object 'sc' to read input.
2. Read an integer 'H' from input.
3. Read an integer 'W' from input.
4. Consume the remaining newline character.
5. Declare a 2D character array 'S' with dimensions [H][W].
6. For each row index 'i' from 0 to H-1, execute:
    a. Read a line of text from input and store in 'text'.
    b. For each column index 'j' from 0 to W-1, execute:
        i. Assign the character at position 'j' in 'text' to S[i][j].
7. Close the Scanner 'sc'.
8. For each row index 'i' from 0 to H-1, execute:
    a. For each column index 'j' from 0 to W-1, execute:
        i. If S[i][j] is '.', then:
            - Initialize 'count' as 0.
            - For each offset 'a' from -1 to 1, execute:
                - If (i + a) is out of bounds (less than 0 or greater than or equal to H), continue to the next iteration of the loop.
                - For each offset 'b' from -1 to 1, execute:
                    - If (j + b) is out of bounds (less than 0 or greater than or equal to W), continue to the next iteration of the loop.
                    - If S[i + a][j + b] equals '#', increment 'count' by 1.
            - Assign the character representation of 'count' (offset by 48) to S[i][j].
        ii. Print S[i][j] to output without a newline.
    b. Print a newline character to output.
