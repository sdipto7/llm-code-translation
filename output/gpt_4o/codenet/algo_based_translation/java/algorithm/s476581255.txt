```
Dependencies:
- Import Scanner from java.util for input operations.

Function Signatures:
- main(String[] args): void
- bubbleSort(int[] a, int n): int

Algorithm:
1. Initialize Scanner object `sc` for reading input.
2. Read an integer `n` from input using `sc.nextInt()`.
3. Declare an integer array `a` with size `n`.
4. Iterate over a range from 0 to `n` (exclusive):
   - Read an integer from input and store it in `a[i]`.
5. Call `bubbleSort(a, n)` and store the result in `count`.
6. Iterate over a range from 0 to `n` (exclusive):
   - If `i` is less than `n-1`, print `a[i]` followed by a space.
   - Otherwise, print `a[i]` followed by a newline.
7. Print the value of `count`.

bubbleSort Function:
1. Declare a boolean variable `flag` and set it to true.
2. Declare an integer variable `count` and initialize it to 0.
3. While `flag` is true:
   - Set `flag` to false.
   - Iterate over a range from `n-1` to 1 (inclusive, decrement by 1):
     - If `a[j]` is less than `a[j-1]`:
       - Swap `a[j]` and `a[j-1]` using a temporary variable `free`.
       - Increment `count` by 1.
       - Set `flag` to true.
4. Return `count`.
