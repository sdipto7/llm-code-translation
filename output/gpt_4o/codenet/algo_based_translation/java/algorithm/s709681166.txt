```
Function Signature:
- main(): void

Variable Declarations:
- sc: Scanner
- s: String
- i: int
- c: char

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize a Scanner object `sc` to read input from the console.
2. Read a line of input from the user and store it in a String variable `s`.
3. Iterate over each character in the string `s` using a for-loop with `i` ranging from 0 to the length of `s` - 1.
   - Inside the loop, declare a character variable `c` and assign it the character at index `i` of the string `s`.
   - If the character `c` is an uppercase letter (check using `Character.isUpperCase(c)`):
     - Convert `c` to its lowercase equivalent by adding 32 to its ASCII value.
     - Print the converted character `c` without a newline.
   - Else if the character `c` is a lowercase letter (check using `Character.isLowerCase(c)`):
     - Convert `c` to its uppercase equivalent by subtracting 32 from its ASCII value.
     - Print the converted character `c` without a newline.
   - Else (if `c` is neither uppercase nor lowercase):
     - Print the character `c` without any modification.
4. After the loop completes, print a newline character.
5. Close the Scanner object `sc`.

Required Libraries:
- java.util.Scanner
