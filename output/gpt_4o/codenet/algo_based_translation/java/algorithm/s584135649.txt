Function Signature:
- main(): void

Variable Declarations:
- sc: Scanner
- i: int
- n: int

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize a Scanner object `sc` to read input from the standard input stream.
2. Declare an integer variable `i` and initialize it to 0.
3. Enter a for-loop with a loop control variable `i` starting from 1 and running while `i` is less than or equal to 5, incrementing `i` by 1 after each iteration.
   - In each iteration, read an integer from input using `sc.nextInt()` and assign it to the variable `n`.
   - If the value of `n` is equal to 0, exit the loop immediately.
4. After exiting the loop, print the value of `i`.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read integers from standard input.
- Output: Print the value of `i` to standard output.

Required Libraries:
- java.util.Scanner
