Algorithm:
1. Import the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package for handling input operations.
2. Define a class named `Main` with the following attributes:
   - An integer variable `high`.
   - An integer variable `low`.
   - An integer variable `sa`.
3. Define a method named `solve` with no parameters and no return type.
   1. Create a `Scanner` object `sc` to read input from the standard input stream.
   2. Initiate a for-loop that iterates 7 times (from `i = 0` to `i < 7`).
      1. Read an integer from input and assign it to the variable `high`.
      2. Read another integer from input and assign it to the variable `low`.
      3. Calculate the difference between `high` and `low` and assign the result to `sa`.
      4. Print the value of `sa`.
4. Define a `main` method with the signature `public static void main(String[] args)`.
   1. Create an instance of the `Main` class named `obj`.
   2. Call the `solve` method on the `obj` instance.
