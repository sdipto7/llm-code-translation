```
Function Signature:
- main() -> void

Variable Declarations:
- sc: Scanner
- n: int
- minN: int
- h: int

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize a Scanner object `sc` to read input from standard input.
2. Read an integer `n` from input.
3. Read another integer, subtract 1 from it, and store it in `minN`.
4. Iterate from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive) using a for-loop:
   a. Read an integer `h` from input.
   b. If `minN` is equal to `h`, set `minN` to `h`.
   c. Else if `minN` is equal to `h-1`, set `minN` to `h-1`.
   d. Else if `minN` is less than `h-1`, set `minN` to `h-1`.
   e. Else if `minN` is greater than `h`, print "No" and exit the program.
5. If loop completes, print "Yes".

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read integers from standard input using Scanner.
- Output: Print "Yes" or "No" to standard output.

Required Libraries:
- java.util.Scanner
