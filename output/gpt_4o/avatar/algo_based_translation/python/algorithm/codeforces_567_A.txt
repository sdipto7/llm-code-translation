Function Signature:
- Function: process_list
- Parameters: None
- Returns: None

Variable Declarations:
- inp: int
- lista: List[int]

Algorithm:
1. Read an integer input from the user and store it in the variable `inp`.
2. Initialize `lista` as an empty list.
3. Read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and store the resulting list in `lista`.
4. Loop over the range from 0 to the length of `lista` (exclusive), with the loop variable `i`.
   a. If `i` is 0:
      - Print the difference between the second element and the first element of `lista`.
      - Print the difference between the last element and the first element of `lista`.
      - Continue to the next iteration of the loop.
   b. Else if `i` is the index of the last element in `lista`:
      - Print the difference between the last element and the second to last element of `lista`.
      - Print the difference between the last element and the first element of `lista`.
      - Continue to the next iteration of the loop.
   c. Else:
      - If the difference between the current element and the previous element is greater than the difference between the next element and the current element:
          - Print the difference between the next element and the current element.
      - Else:
          - Print the difference between the current element and the previous element.
      - If the difference between the last element and the current element is greater than the difference between the current element and the first element:
          - Print the difference between the last element and the current element.
      - Else:
          - Print the difference between the current element and the first element.
