Function Signature:
    calculate_distance(v1: int, v2: int, t: int, d: int) -> int

Variable Declarations:
    v1, v2, t, d: int
    a: int
    v: int
    distance: int
    i: int (loop variable)

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize variables:
    a = 1
    v = v1
    distance = 0

2. Loop over the range from 0 to t-1 (inclusive):
    For each iteration with index i:
    
    a. Check the condition if v - v2 > (t - i - 1) * d:
        - If true:
            i. Set a to -1
            ii. Calculate v as (t - i - 1) * d + v2
        
    b. Add the current value of v to distance
    
    c. Update v by adding a * d to v

3. After loop ends, return the total distance calculated.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read two lines of input from the user, split each line by space, and convert them to integers v1, v2, t, d respectively.
- Output: Print the computed distance.

No external libraries or modules are required.
