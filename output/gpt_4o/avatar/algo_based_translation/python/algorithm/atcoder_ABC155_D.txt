1. Function Signature:
   - Function Name: find_kth_smallest_product
   - Parameters: N (int), K (int), A (List[int])
   - Return Type: int

2. Variable Declarations:
   - ll: int
   - rr: int
   - x: int
   - tot: int
   - l, r, c: int

3. Logic Flow:
   - Initialize `ll` to -10**18 - 1
   - Initialize `rr` to 10**18 + 1
   - Sort the list `A` in non-decreasing order
   - Start a binary search loop while `ll + 1 < rr`
     - Set `x` to the average of `ll` and `rr`
     - Initialize `tot` to 0
     - Iterate over each element `A[i]` in the list `A`
       - If `A[i]` is negative
         - Initialize `l` to -1, `r` to N
         - Start a while loop while `l + 1 < r`
           - Set `c` to the average of `l` and `r`
           - If the product `A[i] * A[c]` is less than `x`
             - Set `r` to `c`
           - Else
             - Set `l` to `c`
         - Add `N - r` to `tot`
       - Else (i.e., `A[i]` is non-negative)
         - Initialize `l` to -1, `r` to N
         - Start a while loop while `l + 1 < r`
           - Set `c` to the average of `l` and `r`
           - If the product `A[i] * A[c]` is less than `x`
             - Set `l` to `c`
           - Else
             - Set `r` to `c`
         - Add `r` to `tot`
       - If the square `A[i] * A[i]` is less than `x`
         - Decrement `tot` by 1
     - Divide `tot` by 2 and floor the result
     - If `tot` is less than `K`
       - Set `ll` to `x`
     - Else
       - Set `rr` to `x`
   - Return `ll`

4. Input/Output Operations:
   - Input: Read integers `N` and `K` from input
   - Input: Read a list of integers `A` from input
   - Output: Print the value of `ll`

5. Libraries/Modules:
   - No external libraries or modules are required
