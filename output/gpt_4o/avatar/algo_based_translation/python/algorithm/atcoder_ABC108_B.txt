Function Signature:
    calculate_coordinates(input_str: str) -> str

Variable Declarations:
    p: List[str]
    x1, y1, x2, y2: int
    DIF1, DIF2: int
    x3, y3, x4, y4: int

Execution Order:
1. Read a line of input as a string and split it by spaces into a list of strings `p`.
2. Convert the first element of `p` to an integer and assign it to `x1`.
3. Convert the second element of `p` to an integer and assign it to `y1`.
4. Convert the third element of `p` to an integer and assign it to `x2`.
5. Convert the fourth element of `p` to an integer and assign it to `y2`.
6. Calculate the difference between `x2` and `x1`, assign to `DIF1`.
7. Calculate the difference between `y2` and `y1`, assign to `DIF2`.
8. Calculate `x3` as `x2 - DIF2`.
9. Calculate `y3` as `y2 + DIF1`.
10. Calculate `x4` as `x1 - DIF2`.
11. Calculate `y4` as `y1 + DIF1`.
12. Convert `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` to strings and concatenate them with spaces in between.
13. Return the concatenated string as the output.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: A single string representing four space-separated integers.
- Output: A string of four space-separated integers.
