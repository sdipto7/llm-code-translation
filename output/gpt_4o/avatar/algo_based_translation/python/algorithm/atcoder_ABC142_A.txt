```
Function next_int() -> int:
    Input: Read a line of input from the user
    Return: Convert the input to an integer and return it

Function next_ints() -> List[int]:
    Input: Read a line of input from the user
    Process: Split the input line into separate strings
    Return: Convert each string to an integer and return the list of integers

Variable n: int
    Assign: Call next_int() to read an integer input

Variable t: int
    Initialize: Set t to 0

For i from 0 to n-1:
    If (i + 1) is odd (i + 1 & 1 evaluates to True):
        Increment t by 1

Output: Print the result of t divided by n as a floating-point number

Required library:
    Import all functions from the math module
