```
Function signature:
- function s() -> str

Variable declarations and data types:
- a: List[int]

Logic flow:
1. Call input() to ignore the first line of input.
2. Read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and store the result in a list `a`.
3. Sort the list `a` in non-decreasing order.
4. Iterate over the list `a` from the second element to the last element with index `i`.
   - If the current element `a[i]` is not equal to the previous element `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]` is less than twice the previous element `a[i - 1]`, return 'YES'.
5. After the loop, if no such pair is found, return 'NO'.

Control structures:
- A for loop iterating over the index range starting from 1 to the length of list `a`.
- An if conditional checking two conditions: `a[i] != a[i - 1]` and `a[i] < a[i - 1] * 2`.

Input/Output operations:
- Use input() to read input values.
- Use print() to output the result of function `s()`.

Libraries, modules, or dependencies:
- None required.
