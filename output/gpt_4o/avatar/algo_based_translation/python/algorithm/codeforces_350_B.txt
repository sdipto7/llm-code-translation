Function signature:
- Input: None
- Output: None

Variable Declarations:
- n: int
- t: List of int with size n+1
- a: List of int with size n+1
- ans: List of int
- cnt: List of int with size n+1
- crt: List of int
- x: int

Execution Order:
1. Read an integer input and assign it to `n`.
2. Read a line of input, split it into integers, prepend 0, and assign to list `t`.
3. Read another line of input, split it into integers, prepend 0, and assign to list `a`.
4. Initialize `ans` as an empty list.
5. Initialize `cnt` as a list of zeros with size n+1.
6. For each element `i` in list `a`:
   - Increment `cnt[i]` by 1.
7. For each integer `i` from 1 to n (inclusive):
   - If `t[i]` equals 1:
     - Initialize `crt` as a list containing `i`.
     - Set `x` to `a[i]`.
     - While `cnt[x]` equals 1 perform the following:
       - Append `x` to `crt`.
       - Update `x` to `a[x]`.
     - If the length of `crt` is greater than the length of `ans`:
       - Copy `crt` to `ans`.
8. Reverse the list `ans`.
9. Print the length of `ans`.
10. Print the elements of `ans` as a space-separated string.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Two lines of space-separated integers
- Output: Two lines, first with the length of ans, second with elements of ans

Dependencies:
- Requires `input` for reading data from standard input.
- Requires `print` and `map` for output and data transformation.
