Function Signature:
  - No explicit function signature as the code executes in a script style

Variable Declarations:
  - y: int
  - arr: List[int]
  - i: int
  - j: int
  - k: int

Logic Flow:
1. Accept an integer input and assign it to variable `y`.
2. Accept a space-separated input of integers, convert each to an integer, and store them in list `arr`.
3. Iterate over each element in `arr` using index `i` (range from 0 to length of `arr` - 1).
   a. Iterate over each element in `arr` using index `j` (range from 0 to length of `arr` - 1).
      i. If `i` is equal to `j`, skip the current iteration.
      ii. Iterate over each element in `arr` using index `k` (range from 0 to length of `arr` - 1).
         - Check if:
           - `arr[k]` is not equal to `arr[j]`
           - `arr[k]` is not equal to `arr[i]`
           - `arr[k]` is equal to the sum of `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`
         - If all conditions are true, print the values of `k + 1`, `j + 1`, and `i + 1`, then exit the program.
4. If no valid triplet is found, print `-1`.

Control Structures:
- Nested for loops iterating over indices of the list `arr`.
- Conditional statements checking index equality and sum conditions.
- Continue statement to skip iterations.
- Exit statement to terminate the program early if a solution is found.

Input/Output Operations:
- Two input operations to collect `y` and `arr`.
- Print output of indices when a valid triplet is found or `-1` if none exists.

Dependencies:
- No external libraries or modules required.
