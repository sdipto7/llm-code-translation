```
Function signature:
  No function is defined; the code is executed in a procedural style.

Variable declarations and data types:
  a: integer
  b: integer
  c: integer

Logic flow:
1. Read a line of input from the user.
2. Split the input string into two parts.
3. Convert the two parts into integers and assign them to variables 'a' and 'b'.
4. Initialize 'c' to 0.

Control structures:
5. Loop: Execute the following block of code 2 times.
   a. Add the maximum of 'a' and 'b' to 'c'.
   b. Conditional: If 'a' is greater than or equal to 'b':
      i. Subtract 1 from 'a'.
   c. Else (if 'b' is greater than 'a'):
      i. Subtract 1 from 'b'.

Output operations:
6. Print the value of 'c'.

Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
  None
