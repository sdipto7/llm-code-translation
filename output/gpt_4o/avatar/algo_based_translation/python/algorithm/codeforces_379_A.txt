```plaintext
Input:
  - Read a line from standard input, split the line by spaces, and convert each part to an integer.
  - Assign the first integer to `candeleIntere` and the second integer to `b`.

Initialize:
  - Declare an integer `s` and set it to 0.
  - Declare an integer `restoSciolte` and set it to 0.

Loop:
  - While `candeleIntere` is greater than 0 or `restoSciolte` is greater than or equal to `b`:
    - Add the integer division of `restoSciolte` by `b` to `candeleIntere`.
    - Update `restoSciolte` to be the remainder of `restoSciolte` divided by `b`.
    - Add `candeleIntere` to `s`.
    - Update `restoSciolte` by adding the remainder of `candeleIntere` divided by `b`.
    - Update `candeleIntere` to be the integer division of `candeleIntere` by `b`.

Output:
  - Print the value of `s`.
