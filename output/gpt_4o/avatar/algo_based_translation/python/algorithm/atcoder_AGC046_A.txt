Algorithm:

1. **Import Required Library**
   - Import the `gcd` function from the `math` module.

2. **Input Operation**
   - Declare an integer variable `x`.
   - Read an integer input from the user and assign it to `x`.

3. **Processing and Output**
   - Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `360` and `x` using the `gcd` function.
   - Perform integer division of `360` by the computed GCD value.
   - Print the result of the division.

The algorithm assumes that `x` is a non-zero positive integer as the input to ensure valid computation of GCD and division.
