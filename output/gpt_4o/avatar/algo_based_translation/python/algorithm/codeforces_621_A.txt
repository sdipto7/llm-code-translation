```
Function Signature:
    No specific functions are defined; the logic operates within the main execution flow.

Variables:
    n: int - Stores the number of elements in the list.
    lst: List[int] - Stores the list of integers input by the user.
    od: int - Counter for the number of odd numbers in the list.
    sum: int - Accumulator for the resulting sum based on given conditions.
    ok: int - Toggle to manage the addition of odd numbers.

Execution Flow:
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to 'n'.
2. Read a space-separated string of integers from the user, map them to integers, convert to a list, and assign to 'lst'.
3. Sort 'lst' in ascending order.
4. Reverse 'lst' to arrange it in descending order.
5. Initialize 'od' to 0.
6. Iterate over each element 'i' in 'lst':
    a. If 'i' is odd (i.e., i & 1 is true), increment 'od' by 1.
7. Initialize 'sum' to 0.
8. Initialize 'ok' to 0.
9. Iterate over the range from 0 to 'n' (exclusive):
    a. If 'lst[i]' is even (i.e., lst[i] % 2 == 0), add 'lst[i]' to 'sum'.
    b. Otherwise, if 'ok' is true or 'od' is greater than 1:
        i. Add 'lst[i]' to 'sum'.
        ii. Decrement 'od' by 1.
        iii. Toggle 'ok' (set to not ok).
10. Output the value of 'sum'.

Required Libraries/Modules/Dependencies:
