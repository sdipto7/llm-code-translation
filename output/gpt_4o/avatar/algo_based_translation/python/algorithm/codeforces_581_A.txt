1. Function Signature:
   - Function Name: `calculate_min_max_difference`
   - Parameters: None
   - Return Type: Tuple[int, int]

2. Variable Declarations:
   - `a`: int
   - `b`: int
   - `min_value`: int
   - `max_value`: int
   - `difference`: int

3. Logic Flow:
   - Read a single line of input from the user.
   - Split the input string by spaces into a list of strings.
   - Convert the list of strings to a list of integers using `map`.
   - Assign the first integer to variable `a`.
   - Assign the second integer to variable `b`.
   - Calculate `min_value` as the minimum of `a` and `b` using the `min` function.
   - Calculate `max_value` as the maximum of `a` and `b` using the `max` function.
   - Calculate `difference` as the integer division of the subtraction of `min_value` from `max_value` by 2.
   - Return a tuple containing `min_value` and `difference`.

4. Control Structures:
   - No loops or conditionals are present.

5. Input/Output Operations:
   - Input is read from standard input using `input()`.
   - Output is returned as a tuple of integers.

6. Required Libraries:
   - No external libraries or modules are required.
