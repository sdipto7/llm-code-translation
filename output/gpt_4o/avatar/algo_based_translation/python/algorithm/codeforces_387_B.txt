```
Function: main() -> None

1. Input:
   - Read line of input and split into integers to assign to variables `n` (int) and `m` (int).
   - Read line of input and split into a list of integers assigned to `round_complexity` (List[int]).
   - Read line of input and split into a list of integers assigned to `george_complexity` (List[int]).

2. Variable Declarations:
   - `i` (int): initialized to 0, used as an index for `round_complexity`.
   - `j` (int): initialized to 0, used as an index for `george_complexity`.

3. Logic Flow:
   - While loop: `while (i < n and j < m)`
     - Condition: `round_complexity[i] <= george_complexity[j]`
       - If True: Increment `i` by 1.
     - Increment `j` by 1 regardless of condition.

4. Output:
   - Print the result of the expression `n - i` (int).
