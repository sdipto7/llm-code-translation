Function Signature:
    def distribute_candies(n: int, m: int) -> int

Algorithm:
    Input:
        - Read a single line of input, splitting it into two integers, n and m

    Variables:
        - n: int, the number of children
        - m: int, the number of candies
        - i: int, initialized to 1, represents the current child's turn

    Logic:
        - Start a loop that continues as long as m is greater than or equal to i
            - Subtract i from m
            - Update i to the next child's turn using the formula (i % n) + 1
        - Once the loop exits, m holds the number of candies that cannot be distributed

    Output:
        - Print the remaining number of candies, m

Dependencies:
    - No external libraries or modules are required
