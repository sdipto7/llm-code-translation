Algorithm:

1. Function Signature:
   - No specific function signature since code is executed in the global scope.

2. Variable Declarations:
   - `n`: Integer; stores the user input converted to an integer.

3. Input Operation:
   - Prompt user for input and convert it to an integer to initialize `n`.

4. Loop Structure:
   - While Loop: Execute as long as `n` is divisible by 2 (i.e., `n % 2 == 0`).
     - Divide `n` by 2 and update `n`.

5. Conditional Structure:
   - If-Else Conditional:
     - If `n` is equal to 1:
       - Print 'YES'.
     - Else:
       - Print 'NO'.

6. Output Operations:
   - Print 'YES' if the final value of `n` is 1.
   - Print 'NO' if the final value of `n` is not 1.

7. No external libraries or modules required.
