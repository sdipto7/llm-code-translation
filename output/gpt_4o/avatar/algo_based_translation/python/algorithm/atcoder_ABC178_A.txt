```
Dependencies:
- import os
- from sys import stdin, stdout

Function signature:
- `solve(tc: int) -> None`

Variable declarations:
- `a: int`

Logic flow:
1. Read a single line of input using `stdin.readline()`.
2. Strip any leading/trailing whitespace from the input and convert it to an integer, assign it to `a`.
3. Evaluate the conditional: if `a` is equal to 0, print the integer 1.
4. Otherwise, print the integer 0.

Control structures:
- Conditional: `if a == 0`, execute `print(1)`, else execute `print(0)`.

Input/output operations:
- Input: Read from standard input using `stdin.readline()`.
- Output: Write to standard output using `print()`.

Execution flow:
1. Initialize `tcs` to 1, which represents the total number of test cases.
2. Initialize `tc` to 1, which represents the current test case index.
3. Start a while loop with the condition `tc <= tcs`:
   - Call the `solve(tc)` function.
   - Increment `tc` by 1.
