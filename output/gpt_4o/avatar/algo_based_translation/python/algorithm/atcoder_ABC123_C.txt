Algorithm:
1. Import necessary libraries:
   - math for mathematical operations.
   - numpy as np (although it's imported, it is not used in the code).
   - fractions and gcd from fractions module (although imported, not used in the code).
   - statistics (imported but not used).
   - collections (imported but not used).
   - functools for reduce (although imported, not used).
   - itertools (imported but not used).

2. Input: Read an integer N from standard input.

3. Input: Read 5 integers from standard input and store them in a list A.

4. Processing:
   a. Find the minimum value in the list A.
   b. Calculate the ceiling of the division of N by the minimum value found in step 4a.
   c. Add 4 to the result obtained from step 4b.

5. Output: Print the result from step 4c.
