Algorithm:

- Function Signature:
  - Function: `process_input() -> int`

- Variable Declarations and Data Types:
  - `ip`: `str` - stores the input string from the user
  - `st`: `str` - initializes as an empty string, used to build the output string
  - `n`: `int` - used within the loop to store the transformed digit

- Logic Flow:
  1. Read input from the user and store it in the variable `ip`.
  2. Initialize an empty string `st`.
  3. If the length of `ip` is not equal to 1:
     - Check if the first character of `ip` is "9":
       - If true, set `st` to "9".
       - Update `ip` by removing the first character.
     - Loop through each character `i` in the string `ip`:
       - Convert `i` to an integer and check if it is greater than 4:
         - If true, calculate `n` as `9 - int(i)`.
         - Append `str(n)` to `st`.
       - Else, append `i` to `st`.
  4. Else, set `st` to `ip`.
  5. Convert `st` to an integer and print it.

- Control Structures:
  - Conditional:
    - If-else to check the length of `ip`.
    - Nested if to check if the first character is "9".
    - Nested if-else within the loop to check if the integer value of `i` is greater than 4.
  - Loop:
    - For loop to iterate over each character in `ip`.

- Input/Output Operations and Data Processing Logic:
  - Input: Read a string from the user.
  - Output: Print the integer value of the transformed string stored in `st`.

- Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
  - None.
