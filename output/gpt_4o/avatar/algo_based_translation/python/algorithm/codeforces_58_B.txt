Algorithm:

1. Function signature:
   - Function name: `find_divisors`
   - Parameters: None
   - Return type: None

2. Variable declarations:
   - `n`: integer

3. Input operation:
   - Read an integer from standard input and assign it to `n`.

4. Loop structure:
   - Use a `for` loop with the loop variable `i` initialized to `n`, iterating down to 1 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each iteration.

5. Conditional structure:
   - Inside the loop, check if `n` is divisible by `i` using the condition `if n % i == 0`.

6. Logic flow:
   - If the condition is true, execute the following steps:
     - Assign `i` to `n`.
     - Print the value of `i` followed by a space, without a newline (`end=' '`).

7. Output operation:
   - Output is handled by the `print` function, displaying each divisor of the initial value of `n` in descending order.
