Function Signature:
    function decode_string(s: str) -> str

Variable Declarations:
    result: str
    i: int

Algorithm:
1. Initialize result as an empty string.
2. Initialize i to 0.
3. Start a while loop that continues as long as i is less than the length of s.
    a. Check if the character at position i in s is a dot ('.').
        i. If true, append '0' to result.
    b. Otherwise (if the character is not '.'):
        i. Increment i by 1.
        ii. Check if the character at the new position i in s is a dot ('.').
            - If true, append '1' to result.
            - Otherwise, append '2' to result.
    c. Increment i by 1.
4. After the loop ends, return the result string.
