```
Function Signature:
- Function: find_first_zero_index
- Parameters: None
- Return Type: int

Variable Declarations:
- a: list of integers
- e: integer (index of the current element in the loop)
- i: integer (value of the current element in the loop)

Logic Flow:
1. Read a line of input from the user.
2. Split the input string by spaces to get individual number strings.
3. Convert each number string to an integer.
4. Store the list of integers in variable `a`.
5. Iterate over the list `a` using `enumerate` to get both the index (`e`) and the value (`i`) of each element.
6. In each iteration, check if the current element `i` is equal to 0.
7. If `i` is equal to 0, print the index `e` incremented by 1 and exit the loop.

Control Structures:
- Loop: for loop using `enumerate` to iterate over list `a`.
- Conditional: if statement to check if the current element `i` is equal to 0.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read a single line of space-separated numbers from the user.
- Output: Print the 1-based index of the first occurrence of 0 in the list.

Required Libraries:
- None
