```
Function Signature:
- Function Name: calculate_steps
- Parameters: 
  - t: int
  - s: int
  - q: int
- Return Type: int

Variable Declarations:
- ans: int, initialized to 0

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize ans to 0.
2. Start a loop with the condition that s is less than t.
   - Inside the loop:
     - Multiply s by q and update the value of s.
     - Increment ans by 1.
3. Once the loop exits, return the value of ans.

Control Structures:
- While loop with the condition (s < t).

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read three space-separated integers from standard input and assign them to t, s, q.
- Output: Print the value of ans after computation.

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- None
