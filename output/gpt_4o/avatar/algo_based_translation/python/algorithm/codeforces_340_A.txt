```
Function G(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    While a % b is not equal to 0:
        Assign a the value of b
        Assign b the value of a % b
    Return b

Function L(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    Return the integer division of a * b by G(a, b)

Declare l as a list of strings obtained by splitting user input on spaces
Declare x, y, a, b as integers converted from the first, second, third, and fourth elements of l respectively
Declare lcm as the result of calling L(x, y)

Output the result of integer division of b by lcm minus integer division of (a - 1) by lcm
