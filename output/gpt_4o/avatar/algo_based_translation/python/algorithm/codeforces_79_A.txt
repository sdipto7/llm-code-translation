Algorithm: Determine the winning player in a turn-based resource deduction game.

Function Signature:
- Function: determine_winner
- Parameters: None
- Return Type: str

Variables and Data Types:
- x: int
- y: int
- a: int (initialized to 0)

Logic Flow and Control Structures:
1. Parse input:
   - Read input as a string.
   - Split the string by spaces.
   - Convert each split string to an integer to obtain x and y.

2. Initialize variable:
   - Set a to 0.

3. Execute loop with condition:
   - While (x >= 0 and y >= 22) or (x >= 1 and y >= 12) or (x >= 2 and y >= 2):
     a. Conditional check:
        - If a is truthy (a = 1):
          i. Inner conditional sequence:
             - If y >= 22:
               * Subtract 22 from y.
             - Else if x >= 1 and y >= 12:
               * Subtract 1 from x.
               * Subtract 12 from y.
             - Else:
               * Subtract 2 from x.
               * Subtract 2 from y.

        - Else (a is falsy, a = 0):
          i. Inner conditional sequence:
             - If x >= 2 and y >= 2:
               * Subtract 2 from x.
               * Subtract 2 from y.
             - Else if x >= 1 and y >= 12:
               * Subtract 1 from x.
               * Subtract 12 from y.
             - Else:
               * Subtract 22 from y.

     b. Toggle a:
        - Set a to 1 - a.

4. Determine output:
   - Return 'Ciel' if a is 0, else return 'Hanako'.

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Read a line of space-separated integers.
- Output: Print the name of the winning player ('Ciel' or 'Hanako').

Required Libraries:
- No external libraries or modules required.
