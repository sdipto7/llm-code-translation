Algorithm:
1. Function Signature:
   - `def process_numbers(n: int, k: int, M: List[int]) -> None`

2. Variable Declarations:
   - `n`: int
   - `k`: int
   - `M`: List[int]
   - `m`: int, initialized to 0
   - `j`: int, used in the outer loop
   - `p`: int, used in the inner loops
   - `l`: int, used in the innermost loop

3. Logic Flow:
   - Read two integers `n` and `k` from input.
   - Read a list of integers `M` from input.
   - Initialize variable `m` to 0.
   - Outer loop: Iterate over variable `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
     - Inner loop: Iterate over variable `p` from 0 to `n-1`.
       - Conditional: If `M[p]` is equal to 0, execute the following:
         - Print `p+1` followed by a space, without a newline.
         - Break out of the inner loop.
     - Innermost loop: Iterate over variable `l` from 0 to `p+1-k`.
       - Decrement `M[l]` by 1.
     - Decrement `M[p]` by 1.

4. Control Structures:
   - Two nested `for` loops for iterating over indices `j` and `p`.
   - Conditional statement inside the inner loop to check if `M[p]` is 0.
   - A `for` loop inside the conditional block for iterating over `l`.

5. Input/Output Operations:
   - Input: Read two integers and a list of integers from input.
   - Output: Print a number followed by a space when a condition is met.

6. Required Libraries:
   - No external libraries or modules are required.
