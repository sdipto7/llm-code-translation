1. Function Signature:
   - `def check_pattern(t: List[List[str]]) -> str:`

2. Variable Declarations:
   - `t`: List of lists of strings, initialized as an empty list.
   - `black`: Integer, initialized to 0.
   - `white`: Integer, initialized to 0.
   - `correct`: Integer, initialized to 0.
   - `i`: Integer, used as a loop counter.
   - `j`: Integer, used as a loop counter.

3. Logic Flow:
   - Initialize `t` as an empty list to store input grid.
   - Loop from `i = 0` to `i = 3` (inclusive):
     - Read a line of input, split it into characters, store as list `l`.
     - Append list `l` to list `t`.
   - Initialize `black`, `white`, and `correct` to 0.
   - Loop from `i = 0` to `i = 2` (inclusive):
     - Loop from `j = 0` to `j = 2` (inclusive):
       - Check character at `t[i][j]`:
         - If it is '#', increment `black` by 1.
         - Else, increment `white` by 1.
       - Check character at `t[i][j + 1]`:
         - If it is '#', increment `black` by 1.
         - Else, increment `white` by 1.
       - Check character at `t[i + 1][j]`:
         - If it is '#', increment `black` by 1.
         - Else, increment `white` by 1.
       - Check character at `t[i + 1][j + 1]`:
         - If it is '#', increment `black` by 1.
         - Else, increment `white` by 1.
       - Check if any of the following conditions are true:
         - `black == 0`
         - `black == 3`
         - `white == 0`
         - `white == 3`
         - `white == 4`
         - `black == 4`
       - If any condition is true, set `correct` to 1 and break the inner loop.
       - Reset `black` and `white` to 0.
   - If `correct` is 1, return 'YES'.
   - Else, return 'NO'.

4. Input/Output Operations:
   - Input: Four lines of strings from standard input.
   - Output: Print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the evaluation of the grid pattern.

5. Required Libraries:
   - None.
