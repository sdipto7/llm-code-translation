```plaintext
1. Import the numpy library as np.

2. Define a function that takes no parameters and returns an integer:
   a. Read an integer input from the user and store it in variable N (type: int).

3. Declare an empty list n (type: list of int).
   a. Read a line of input from the user, split the string by spaces, and convert each element to an integer.
   b. Store the list of integers in variable n.

4. Convert the list n into a numpy array and store it back in n (type: numpy array of int).

5. Initialize a variable a with the value 1 (type: int).

6. Initialize a variable pos with the value 0 (type: int).

7. Begin a for loop iterating over the range from 1 to N (exclusive):
   a. Check if the element at position pos in n is greater than the element at position i in n.
   b. If the condition is true:
      i. Increment the value of a by 1.
      ii. Update the value of pos to i.

8. Print the value of a.

9. End of function.
