Algorithm:

1. Function Signature:
   - Function: main
   - Parameters: None
   - Return Type: None

2. Variable Declarations:
   - L: List of integers, initially empty
   - r: Integer, initialized to 1
   - k: String, used as loop iterator
   - j: String, used as loop iterator

3. Input/Output Operations:
   - Read input from the user (not used in logic)
   - Read second input from the user, split it by spaces into a list of strings

4. Logic Flow:
   - Initialize an empty list `L`
   - Initialize an integer `r` to 1
   - For each element `k` in the list obtained from the second input:
     - Convert `k` to integer
     - Append `r` to the list `L`, repeated `int(k)` times
     - Increment `r` by 1
   - Read another input from the user (not used in logic)
   - Read a final input from the user, split it by spaces into a list of strings

5. Control Structures:
   - For loop to iterate over each `k` in the second user input split by spaces
   - For loop to iterate over each `j` in the final user input split by spaces

6. Data Processing Logic:
   - Convert each `j` to an integer, subtract 1, and use it as an index to access elements in list `L`
   - Print the value from list `L` at the calculated index

7. Output:
   - For each `j`, print the value from list `L` at the index `int(j) - 1`
