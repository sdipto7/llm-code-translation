Read two integers from input and assign them to N and K.

Read N integers from input and store them in a list named lst.

Initialize two empty lists: lst_p and lst_m.

For each integer in lst:
    - If the integer is zero, decrement K by 1.
    - If the integer is positive, append it to lst_p.
    - If the integer is negative, append it to lst_m.

Initialize variables p and m to 0.

Initialize variables x and y to 0 and len(lst_m) - 1, respectively.

Set lastx to the length of lst_p.

Set lasty to the length of lst_m.

Define a function check(k) that returns an integer:
    Initialize variable ans to 10^9.

    For each integer j from 0 to k (inclusive):
        - If j is greater than lastx or k - j is greater than lasty, continue to the next iteration.
        - Otherwise:
            - If j is zero, set p to 0. Otherwise, set p to lst_p[j - 1].
            - If k - j is zero, set m to 0. Otherwise, set m to lst_m[lasty - (k - j)].
            - Update ans to the minimum of ans, 2 * p + |m|, and p + 2 * |m|.

    Return ans.

Print the result of calling check(K).
