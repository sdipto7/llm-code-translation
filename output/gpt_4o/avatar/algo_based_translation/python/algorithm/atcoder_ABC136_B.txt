```
Function main() -> None:
    Declare integer N
    Read integer input into N
    Declare integer i, initialized to 1
    Declare integer ans, initialized to 0
    
    While 10 raised to the power of i is less than or equal to N:
        Add (10 raised to the power of i) minus (10 raised to the power of (i - 1)) to ans
        Increment i by 2
    
    Add the maximum of 0 and (N minus 10 raised to the power of (i - 1) plus 1) to ans
    Output ans
```
