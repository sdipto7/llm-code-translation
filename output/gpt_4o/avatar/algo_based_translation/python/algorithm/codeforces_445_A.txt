Algorithm:

1. Define variables:
   - n, m: integers
   - l: list of lists of characters

2. Input operation:
   - Read a line from standard input, split it by spaces, and convert each part to an integer. Assign the first integer to n and the second to m.

3. Initialize an empty list l.

4. Loop from 0 to n-1 (inclusive) with variable i:
   a. Input operation:
      - Read a line from standard input and assign it to variable s.
   b. Convert string s to a list of characters.
   c. Loop from 0 to m-1 (inclusive) with variable j:
      i. Conditional check:
         - If the character s[j] is equal to '.':
           A. Conditional check:
              - If the sum of i and j is odd:
                - Assign the character 'W' to s[j].
              - Else:
                - Assign the character 'B' to s[j].
   d. Append the modified list s to the list l.

5. Loop over each item c in list l:
   a. Output operation:
      - Join the list of characters c into a string and print it to standard output.
