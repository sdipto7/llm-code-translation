Dependencies:
- Import the 'sys' module for reading input

Function Signatures:
- rs() -> str: Reads a line from standard input and returns it without trailing newline
- ri() -> int: Converts the result of rs() into an integer
- rs_() -> List[str]: Splits the result of rs() by whitespace and returns a list of strings
- ri_() -> List[int]: Converts each element of the result of rs_() into integers and returns a list

Algorithm:
1. Read an integer N from input using the ri() function
2. Initialize an integer variable `ans` to 0
3. Loop over the range from 1 to N inclusive:
   a. For each integer i in the range:
      i. Calculate (N // i) as the integer division of N by i
      ii. Calculate (N // i + 1) as the integer division of N by i plus 1
      iii. Multiply i by the result from step 3.a.i
      iv. Multiply the result from step 3.a.iii by the result from step 3.a.ii
      v. Divide the result from step 3.a.iv by 2 using integer division and add this to `ans`
4. Print the final value of `ans`
```
