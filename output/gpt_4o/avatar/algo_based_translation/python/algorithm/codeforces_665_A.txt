Function Signature:
- No function signature present. Main logic is executed directly within the script without a defined function.

Variable Declarations and Data Types:
- a, at: int (input split from first line)
- b, bt: int (input split from second line)
- t1, t2: int (input split from third line, representing hours and minutes)
- st: int (calculated start time in minutes since 5:00)
- fin: int (time when task a finishes, calculated from st and at)
- now: int (current time in minutes since 5:00, initialized to 0)
- ans: int (counter for the number of times task b can start after st, initialized to 0)

Logic Flow:
1. Read and parse first line of input: two integers a and at.
2. Read and parse second line of input: two integers b and bt.
3. Read and parse third line of input: two integers representing time in "HH:MM" format, split into t1 (hours) and t2 (minutes).
4. Calculate st as the number of minutes from 5:00 to the given time (t1:t2). Use the formula: `st = t2 + (t1 - 5) * 60`.
5. Calculate fin as the end time of task a, using the formula: `fin = st + at`.
6. Initialize now to 0 (representing current time in minutes since 5:00).
7. Initialize ans to 0 (to count the number of times task b can start after st).
8. Enter a while loop with the condition: `now < fin and now < 1140`.
   - Inside the loop, check if `now + bt > st`.
     - If true, increment ans by 1.
   - Increment now by b.
9. Exit loop when condition is false.
10. Print the value of ans.

Control Structures:
- while loop: `while now < fin and now < 1140`
- if condition: `if now + bt > st`

Input/Output Operations:
- Input: Three lines containing two integers each (first two lines) and a time in "HH:MM" format (third line).
- Output: Integer (the value of ans).

Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
- None.
