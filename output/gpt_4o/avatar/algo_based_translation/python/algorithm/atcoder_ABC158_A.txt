```
- Input: Read a string from standard input and store it in a variable `stdin` (string).
- Variable Declaration:
  - `s` (string): Assign the value of `stdin` to `s`.
  - `result` (string): Declare a variable `result`.
- Logic and Control Flow:
  - Conditional Check: If the character 'A' is present in `s` and the character 'B' is present in `s`:
    - Assign "Yes" to `result`.
  - Else:
    - Assign "No" to `result`.
- Output: Print the value of `result`.
- No external libraries, modules, or dependencies are required.
