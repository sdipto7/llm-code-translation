```plaintext
Function main(N: int, d: float, x: float) -> float
    Declare ret as float, initialized to 0
    While N is not 0
        Set ret to ret plus d plus (N - 0.5) multiplied by x
        Set d to d plus (d divided by N) plus (5 multiplied by x) divided by (2 multiplied by N)
        Set x to x plus (2 multiplied by x) divided by N
        Decrement N by 1
    Return ret

Import sys module
Assign read to sys.stdin.buffer.read
Assign readline to sys.stdin.buffer.readline
Assign readlines to sys.stdin.buffer.readlines
Read input using read and split into N, d, x as integers and floats
Call function main with N, d, x and print the result
