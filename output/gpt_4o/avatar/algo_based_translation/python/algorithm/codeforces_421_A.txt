Algorithm:

1. Function Signature:
   - Function: assign_teams
   - Parameters: none
   - Return Type: none

2. Variable Declarations:
   - n: int
   - a: int
   - b: int
   - lista: List[int]
   - listb: List[int]

3. Input Operations:
   - Read a single line of input, split it by space, and convert each element to an integer. Assign the first, second, and third values to n, a, and b, respectively.
   - Read a single line of input, split it by space, and convert each element to an integer. Assign the resulting list to lista.
   - Read a single line of input, split it by space, and convert each element to an integer. Assign the resulting list to listb.

4. Logic Flow:
   - Loop over a range of integers from 0 to n-1, inclusive. Use variable k to track the current index in the loop.
     - Conditional Check:
       - If k + 1 is present in lista:
         - Output the integer 1 followed by a space, without a newline.
       - Else:
         - Output the integer 2 followed by a space, without a newline.

5. Output Operations:
   - Print 1 or 2 based on the condition in the loop, separated by spaces.
