Function Signature:
    Function: calculate_score
    Parameters: None
    Returns: int

Variable Declarations:
    s: List of str
    num_g: int
    num_p: int
    score: int
    x: str

Execution Logic:
1. Read input from the user and convert it into a list of characters.
   - s = list(input())

2. Initialize num_g, num_p, and score to 0.
   - num_g = 0
   - num_p = 0
   - score = 0

3. Iterate over each character x in the list s.
   For each character x in s:
   - if x is equal to 'g':
     a. Check if the difference between num_g and num_p is greater than 0.
        If True:
            i. Increment score by 1.
            ii. Increment num_p by 1.
        Else:
            i. Assign score to itself (no change).
            ii. Increment num_g by 1.
   - elif x is equal to 'p':
     a. Check if the difference between num_g and num_p is greater than 0.
        If True:
            i. Assign score to itself (no change).
            ii. Increment num_p by 1.
        Else:
            i. Decrement score by 1.
            ii. Increment num_g by 1.

4. Print the final score value.
   - print(score)
