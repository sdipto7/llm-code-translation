```
Import the following modules:
- defaultdict and deque from collections
- lru_cache from functools
- heappush and heappop from heapq
- Counter from typing
- bisect_right and bisect_left from bisect
- math

Define a function named solution with no parameters and no return value.
    Declare a variable line and assign it the result of input().
    Declare a variable bought_count and assign it a Counter object initialized with line.
    Reassign line with the result of input().
    Declare a variable made_count and assign it a Counter object initialized with line.
    Declare a variable res and initialize it to 0.
    Iterate over each element color in made_count.
        If color is not in bought_count, print -1 and return.
        Add the minimum of bought_count[color] and made_count[color] to res.
    Print the value of res.

Define a function named main with no parameters and no return value.
    Declare a variable t and set it to 1.
    Iterate over a range of t.
        Call the solution function.

Call the main function.
