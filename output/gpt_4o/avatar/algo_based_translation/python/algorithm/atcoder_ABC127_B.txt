```
- Function Signature:
  - No specific function signature; logic is executed in the main block.

- Variable Declarations:
  - `r`: int
  - `D`: int
  - `x`: int
  - `i`: int (used in loop)

- Input Operation:
  - Read a single line of input and split it into three integers `r`, `D`, and `x`.

- Control Structures and Logic:
  - Loop from `i = 2` to `i < 12` (inclusive of 2, exclusive of 12):
    - Calculate the value using the formula:
      - `value = (r ** (i - 1)) * (x + D / (1 - r)) - D / (1 - r)`
    - Convert the result to an integer.
    - Output the integer result.

- Output Operation:
  - Print the integer result calculated in each iteration of the loop.

- No external libraries, modules, or dependencies are required.
