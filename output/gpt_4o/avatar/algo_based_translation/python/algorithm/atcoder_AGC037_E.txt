```
1. Input two integers N and K.
2. Input a string S of length N.

3. Initialize a boolean variable 'aaaa' to False.

4. If K is greater than or equal to 15, set 'aaaa' to True.
5. Else, if 2 raised to the power of K is greater than or equal to N, set 'aaaa' to True.

6. If 'aaaa' is True:
   - Print the minimum character in S repeated N times.
   - Exit the program.

7. Define a function 'get_last_dict(s_str: str) -> str':
   - Concatenate s_str with its reverse and store in U.
   - Find the minimum character in s_str and store in c.
   - Find the first occurrence of c in U and store the index in p.
   - Set minindex to p.
   - Increment p by 1.

8. While p is less than or equal to N:
   - If U[p] equals c:
     - If 'check_normal_dict(U, minindex, p)' returns True:
       - Set minindex to p.
   - Increment p by 1.

9. Return the substring of U starting from minindex with length N.

10. Define a function 'check_normal_dict(u: str, pointer1: int, pointer2: int) -> bool':
    - Loop over range N:
      - If u[pointer1 + i] is greater than u[pointer2 + i]:
        - Return True.
      - Else if u[pointer1 + i] is less than u[pointer2 + i]:
        - Return False.
    - Return False.

11. Call 'get_last_dict(S)' and assign the result back to S.

12. If K equals 1:
    - Print S.
    - Exit the program.

13. Initialize an integer variable 'count' to 0.

14. For each character c in S:
    - If c equals the first character of S:
      - Increment count by 1.
    - Else:
      - Break the loop.

15. If count multiplied by 2 raised to the power of (K - 1) is greater than or equal to N:
    - Print the first character of S repeated N times.

16. Else:
    - Set S to the first character of S repeated (count multiplied by (2 raised to the power of (K - 1) minus 1)) concatenated with S.
    - Print the first N characters of S.
