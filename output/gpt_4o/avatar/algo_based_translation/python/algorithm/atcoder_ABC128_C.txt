```
Function:
- main() -> None

Variables:
- n: int
- m: int
- li: List[List[int]]
- p: Tuple[int, ...]
- q: Set[int]
- r: Set[int]
- v: Set[int]
- ans: int
- i: int
- s: Tuple[int, ...] or Set[int]
- u: List[int]
- w: int

Logic Flow:
1. Import itertools module.
2. Read two integers n, m from input.
3. Initialize list `li` with m lists, each obtained by reading a line, mapping to integers, and slicing from the second element onward.
4. Initialize tuple `p` by reading a line and mapping it to integers.
5. Create set `q` containing all unique integers from the flattened lists in `li`.
6. Create set `r` with integers from 1 to n.
7. Calculate set `v` as the difference between `r` and `q`.
8. Initialize `ans` to 0.
9. Iterate `i` from 0 to the length of `q` (inclusive).
   a. For each `i`, generate combinations of `q` taken `i` at a time, and iterate over each combination as `s`.
   b. Convert `s` to a set.
   c. For each pair `(u, w)` zipped from `li` and `p`:
      i. Check if the size of the intersection of `s` and the set of `u` modulo 2 is not equal to `w`.
      ii. If true, break the inner loop and continue with the next combination.
   d. If the inner loop completes without breaking, increment `ans` by `2` raised to the power of the length of `v`.
10. Print the value of `ans`.

Input/Output:
- Input: Standard input to read values for n, m, lists in li, and tuple p.
- Output: Print the integer `ans`.

Dependencies:
- itertools module for generating combinations.
- Standard input/output for reading and printing data.
