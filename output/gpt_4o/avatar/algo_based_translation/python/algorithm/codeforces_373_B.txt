```
Function Signature:
- sum(k: int) -> int

Variable Declarations:
- ret: int
- pw: int
- len: int
- cur: int
- prev: int
- w: int
- m: int
- k: int
- lo: int
- hi: int
- md: int
- c: int

Function Logic for sum(k):
1. Initialize ret to 0.
2. Initialize pw to 10.
3. Initialize len to 1.
4. Begin an infinite loop:
   - Set cur to the minimum of (pw - 1) and k.
   - Set prev to pw divided by 10.
   - Update ret by adding (cur - prev + 1) multiplied by len.
   - If (pw - 1) is greater than or equal to k, break the loop.
   - Increment len by 1.
   - Multiply pw by 10.
5. Return ret.

Main Logic:
1. Read integers w, m, and k from input.
2. Initialize lo to 0.
3. Initialize hi to 1e18 cast to integer.
4. Begin a loop with condition (hi - lo > 1):
   - Compute md as the integer division of (lo + hi) by 2.
   - Compute c as the result of calling sum(m + md - 1) minus the result of calling sum(m - 1).
   - If (c * k) is less than or equal to w, set lo to md.
   - Otherwise, set hi to md.
5. Print the value of lo.
