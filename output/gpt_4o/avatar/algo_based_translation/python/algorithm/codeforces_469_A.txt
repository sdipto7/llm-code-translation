1. Function signature:
   - None (code executed directly in the global scope)

2. Variable declarations and data types:
   - `max_level`: int
   - `x`: list of int
   - `y`: list of int
   - `z`: set of int

3. Algorithm execution flow:
   1. Read an integer from input and assign it to `max_level`.
   2. Read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and store it in the list `x`.
   3. Read another line of input, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and store it in the list `y`.
   4. Remove the first element from the list `x`.
   5. Remove the first element from the list `y`.
   6. Convert the list `x` to a set.
   7. Convert the list `y` to a set.
   8. If 0 is in set `x`, remove 0 from `x`.
   9. Else if 0 is in set `y`, remove 0 from `y`.
   10. Create a union of sets `x` and `y`, and assign it to `z`.
   11. If the length of set `z` is not equal to `max_level`, print "Oh, my keyboard!".
   12. Else, print "I become the guy."

4. Control structures:
   - Conditional: `if 0 in x`
   - Conditional: `elif 0 in y`
   - Conditional: `if len(z) != max_level`

5. Input/output operations:
   - Input: Read integers and lists from standard input.
   - Output: Print a message to standard output.

6. Required libraries, modules, or dependencies:
   - None (uses only built-in functions and types)
