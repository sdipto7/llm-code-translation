Function Signature:
- Function: calculate_tower_and_maximum_height
- Parameters: n: int, l: List[int]
- Returns: Tuple[int, int]

Algorithm:
1. Variable Declarations:
   - high: int, initialized to 1
   - tower: int, initialized to n
   - maximum: int, initialized to 1

2. Sort the list 'l' in ascending order.

3. Loop through the sorted list 'l' starting from index 1 to n-1:
   a. If the current element l[i] is equal to the previous element l[i-1]:
      - Decrement tower by 1
      - Increment high by 1
   b. Else:
      - If high is greater than maximum:
        - Set maximum to high
      - Reset high to 1

4. After the loop, check if high is greater than maximum:
   a. If true, set maximum to high

5. Return a tuple containing maximum and tower
