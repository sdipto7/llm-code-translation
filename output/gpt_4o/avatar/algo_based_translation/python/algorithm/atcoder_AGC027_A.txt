Algorithm:

1. Define a lambda function `na` that returns a list of integers. 
   - Input: None
   - Output: List[int]

2. Declare variables `n` and `x` as integers, initialized from the first call to `na()`, which reads input and splits it into integers.

3. Declare a list `a` as a sorted list of integers, initialized from the second call to `na()`, which reads input and splits it into integers.

4. Declare an integer `ans` and initialize it to 0.

5. Check if the first element of the sorted list `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is greater than `x`.
   - If true, output 0 and terminate the program.

6. Iterate over each integer `i` in list `a`:
   - If `i` is greater than `x`:
     - Set `x` to 0.
     - Terminate the loop.
   - Otherwise, subtract `i` from `x` and increment `ans` by 1.

7. After the loop, check if `x` is not equal to 0.
   - If true, decrement `ans` by 1.

8. Output the value of `ans`.
