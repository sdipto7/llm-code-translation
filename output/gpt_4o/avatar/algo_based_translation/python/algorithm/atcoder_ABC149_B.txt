```
Function Signature:
    None

Variables:
    cookies: List of integers
    leftOver: Integer
    takahashi: Integer

Logic Flow:
    1. Read a line of input from the user.
    2. Split the input string into separate components based on spaces.
    3. Convert each component to an integer and store them in a list called `cookies`.
    4. Calculate `leftOver` as the difference between the first and third elements of `cookies`.
    5. Calculate `takahashi` as the maximum between 0 and `leftOver`.
    6. If `takahashi` is greater than 0, concatenate `takahashi` and the second element of `cookies` as strings separated by a space.
    7. If `takahashi` is not greater than 0, calculate the maximum between 0 and the difference between the second element of `cookies` and the absolute value of `leftOver`. Concatenate `takahashi` and this result as strings separated by a space.
    8. Print the resulting string.

Control Structures:
    - Conditional: If `takahashi > 0`

Input/Output Operations:
    - Input: Read a single line of input from the user.
    - Output: Print a formatted string based on calculated conditions.

Dependencies:
    - Requires `input()` for reading data from the user.
    - Requires `print()` for output to the console.
    - Requires `int()` for converting string to integer.
    - Requires `max()` for calculating the maximum value.
    - Requires `abs()` for calculating the absolute value.
