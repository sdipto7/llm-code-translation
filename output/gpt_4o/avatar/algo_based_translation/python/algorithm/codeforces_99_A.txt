Algorithm:
1. Function Signature:
   - Function name: process_number
   - Parameters: none
   - Return type: none

2. Variable Declarations:
   - `l`: string
   - `s`: list of characters (strings)
   - `p`: list of characters (strings)
   - `i`: integer

3. Execution Order:
   - Read input from the user and assign it to variable `l`.
   - Split the string `l` at the '.' character, resulting in a list, and reassign it to `l`.
   - Create a list of characters from the first element of `l` (before the '.') and assign it to `s`.
   - Create a list of characters from the second element of `l` (after the '.') and assign it to `p`.
   - Convert the first character of `p` to an integer and assign it to `i`.

4. Control Structures:
   - Conditional: If the last character of `s` is '9', print "GOTO Vasilisa.".
   - Else If the last character of `s` is not '9' and `i` is less than 5:
     - Join the list `s` into a string and print the result.
   - Else:
     - Join the list `s` into a string.
     - Convert the string to an integer, add 1, and convert back to a string.
     - Print the resulting string.

5. Input/Output Operations:
   - Input: Read a single line of input from the user.
   - Output: Print a string based on the conditions evaluated.

6. Required Libraries, Modules, or Dependencies:
   - None
