```plaintext
- Import necessary modules:
  - `sys` for input operations
  - `collections.Counter` for counting occurrences of elements in a list

- Define input operations:
  - Use `sys.stdin.readline` for reading input lines

- Define variables:
  - `n`: integer, number of elements in the input list (read from input)
  - `s`: list of strings, split from the input line
  - `w`: Counter object, counts occurrences of each element in `s`
  - `c`: integer, stores the highest index of the most frequent element found so far, initialized to -1
  - `a`: string, stores the most frequent element with the highest index when ties occur, initialized to an empty string

- Reverse the list `s`

- Iterate over each unique element `i` in the Counter `w`:
  - Check if the count of `i` is equal to the maximum count in `w`
  - If the index of `i` in the reversed list `s` is greater than `c`:
    - Assign `i` to `a`
    - Update `c` with the index of `i` in the reversed list `s`

- Output the result stored in `a`
```
