Algorithm

- Input:
  - Read a single line of input, splitting it into two integers `n` and `m`.
  - `n` and `m` are both integers.

- Variables:
  - `q`: integer, store the result of integer division of `n` by `m`.
  - `r`: integer, store the remainder when `n` is divided by `m`.
  - `a`: list of integers, initialized with `m` elements, each being `q`.

- Logic Flow:
  1. Calculate `q` as the integer division of `n` by `m` (`q = n // m`).
  2. Calculate `r` as the remainder of `n` divided by `m` (`r = n % m`).
  3. Initialize list `a` with `m` elements, each element set to `q`.
  4. Loop over the range from `0` to `r - 1` (inclusive):
     - For each index `i` in this range, increment `a[i]` by 1.
  5. Loop over the range from `0` to `m - 1` (inclusive):
     - For each index `i`, output `a[i]`, followed by a space, without a newline.

- Output:
  - Print the elements of list `a` on a single line, separated by spaces.

- Dependencies:
  - No external libraries or modules are required.
