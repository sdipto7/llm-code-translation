1. Function Signature:
   - Function name: process_numbers
   - Parameters: none
   - Return type: none

2. Variable Declarations:
   - `n`: integer, stores the number of iterations for the loop.
   - `i`: integer, loop control variable.
   - `a`: integer, stores each input number to be processed.

3. Execution Logic:
   - Read an integer from input and assign it to `n`.
   - For each integer from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive):
     - Read an integer from input and assign it to `a`.
     - If `a` is less than 2:
       - Output 0.
     - If `a` is greater than or equal to 2:
       - Output the result of `a - 2`.

4. Control Structures:
   - A loop that iterates `n` times using a range from 0 to `n-1`.
   - A conditional `if` statement to check if `a` is less than 2.
   - Another conditional `if` statement to check if `a` is greater than or equal to 2.

5. Input/Output Operations:
   - Input operation to read an integer for `n`.
   - Input operation to read an integer for `a` inside the loop.
   - Output operation to print results based on the conditions evaluated.

6. Libraries/Dependencies:
   - None required.
