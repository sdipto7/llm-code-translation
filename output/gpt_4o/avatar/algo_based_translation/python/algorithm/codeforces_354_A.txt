```plaintext
- Define a function to calculate minimum energy consumption with parameters:
  - n: int
  - L: int
  - R: int
  - QL: int
  - QR: int
  - W: List[int]
  - Return type: int

- Declare a list sum_el: List[int] initialized with [0]

- Iterate over i from 1 to n (inclusive):
  - Append W[i-1] + sum_el[i-1] to sum_el

- Initialize a variable answer: int as QR * (n - 1) + sum_el[n] * R

- Iterate over i from 1 to n (inclusive):
  - Calculate energy using the formula:
    - L * sum_el[i] + R * (sum_el[n] - sum_el[i])
  
  - If i is greater than (n - i):
    - Increase energy by (i - (n - i) - 1) * QL

  - Else if (n - i) is greater than i:
    - Increase energy by ((n - i) - i - 1) * QR

  - If energy is less than answer:
    - Update answer with energy

- Return answer
