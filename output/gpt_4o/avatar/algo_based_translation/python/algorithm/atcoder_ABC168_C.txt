Input:
    a, b, h, m: integer values read from input, representing two lengths and time in hours and minutes.

Libraries:
    Import the `math` module.

Algorithm:
1. Parse input:
    a, b, h, m = map(int, input().split())

2. Calculate the angle `C` in degrees between the hour and minute hand:
    - Calculate the angle moved by the minute hand:
        angle_minute_hand = 360 / 60 * m
    - Calculate the angle moved by the hour hand:
        angle_hour_hand = 360 / 12 * h + 360 / 12 / 60 * m
    - Find the absolute difference between the two angles:
        C = abs(angle_minute_hand - angle_hour_hand)

3. Normalize the angle `C` to be the smaller angle between the two hands:
    If C > 180:
        C = 360 - C

4. Convert angle `C` to radians:
    angle_C_radians = math.radians(C)

5. Calculate the cosine of angle `C`:
    cosC = math.cos(angle_C_radians)

6. Apply the law of cosines to find the distance between the two ends of the clock hands:
    distance = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2 - 2 * a * b * cosC)

7. Output the calculated distance:
    print(distance)
