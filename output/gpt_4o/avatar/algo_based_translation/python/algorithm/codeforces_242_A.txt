```
Function Signature:
- main() -> None

Variable Declarations:
- x: int
- y: int
- a: int
- b: int
- games: List[Tuple[int, int]]

Algorithm:
1. Read a single line of input, split it by spaces, and convert each part to an integer. Assign these integers to variables x, y, a, and b respectively.
2. Initialize an empty list `games` to store pairs of integers.
3. Loop over each integer `i` from `a` to `x` (inclusive):
   a. If `i` is less than or equal to `b`, skip this iteration.
   b. Otherwise, loop over each integer `j` from `b` to `y` (inclusive):
      i. If `i` is greater than `j`, append the tuple `(i, j)` to the list `games`.
4. Print the length of the list `games`.
5. For each tuple `i` in the list `games`:
   a. Print the two elements of the tuple separated by a space.
