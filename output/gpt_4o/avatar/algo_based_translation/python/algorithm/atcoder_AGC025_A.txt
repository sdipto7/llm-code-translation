```
Function: main() -> None
    Input: None
    Output: None
    
    Variable: n : str
    Variable: a : List[str] = ["10", "100", "1000", "10000", "100000"]
    Variable: new : int

    Step 1: Read input from the user and assign it to variable n.
    
    Step 2: Convert each character of the string n to an integer.
    
    Step 3: Calculate the sum of all integers obtained in Step 2 and assign it to variable new.
    
    Step 4: Check if n is present in the list a.
    
    Step 5: If n is present in a, print the integer 10.
    
    Step 6: If n is not present in a, print the value of new.
