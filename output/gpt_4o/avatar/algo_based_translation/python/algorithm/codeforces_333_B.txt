```
Function Signature:
  Function: main() -> None

Variable Declarations:
  n: int
  m: int
  b: List[int]
  r: int
  c: int

Algorithm:
1. Read a line of input and split it into two integers, assigning them to variables `n` and `m`.
2. Create a list `b` with `2*n` elements, all initialized to 1.
3. Set the first element `b[0]`, the last element of the first half `b[n-1]`, the first element of the second half `b[n]`, and the last element `b[2*n-1]` to 0.
4. Loop `m` times to perform the following:
   a. Read a line of input and split it into two integers, assigning them to `r` and `c`.
   b. Set `b[r-1]` and `b[n+c-1]` to 0.
5. Check if `n` is odd and both `b[n//2]` and `b[n+n//2]` are 1:
   a. If true, set `b[n//2]` to 0.
6. Compute the sum of all elements in `b`.
7. Print the sum.
