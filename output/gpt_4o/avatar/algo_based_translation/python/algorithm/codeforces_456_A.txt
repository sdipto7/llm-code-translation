```
- Function Signature:
  - No explicit function used, operates in a script-like manner
  - Requires input from standard input
  - Output is printed directly to standard output

- Variable Declarations:
  - n: int
  - m: List of List of int
  - a: List of int
  - i: List of int (used in for loop)

- Execution Flow:
  1. Read an integer from input and assign it to `n`
  2. Initialize `m` as a list of lists, where each inner list is populated by reading a line from input, splitting it on spaces, and converting each element to an integer. Repeat this process `n` times.
  3. Sort the list `m` in descending order based on the first element of each inner list.
  4. Assign the first list in `m` to `a`.
  5. Iterate through the sublists of `m` starting from the second element:
     - If the second element of the current sublist `i` is greater than the second element of `a`, print 'Happy Alex' and terminate the loop.
     - Otherwise, assign the current sublist `i` to `a`.
  6. If the loop completes without breaking, print 'Poor Alex'.
