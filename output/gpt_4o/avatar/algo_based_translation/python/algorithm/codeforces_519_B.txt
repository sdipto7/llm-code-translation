```
Algorithm:
1. Declare function `calculate_differences()` with no parameters and return type `None`.
2. Declare variables:
   - `n` of type `int`
   - `a`, `b`, `c` of type `List[int]`
   - `x`, `y`, `z` of type `int`
3. Initialize `x`, `y`, `z` to 0.
4. Read an integer from input and assign it to `n`.
5. Read a line from input, split it into strings, convert each to an integer, and store them in list `a`.
6. Read another line from input, split it into strings, convert each to an integer, and store them in list `b`.
7. Read another line from input, split it into strings, convert each to an integer, and store them in list `c`.
8. For each integer `i` in list `a`, perform:
   - Add `i` to `x`.
9. For each integer `i` in list `b`, perform:
   - Add `i` to `y`.
10. For each integer `i` in list `c`, perform:
    - Add `i` to `z`.
11. Calculate the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, then print the result.
12. Calculate the absolute difference between `y` and `z`, then print the result.
