```
Input: Two integers `n` and `k` from standard input
Input: A string `v` from standard input

Variables:
- `n`: int
- `k`: int
- `v`: str
- `d`: list[str] initialized to ["LEFT", "RIGHT"]
- `f`: bool
- `m`: int
- `a`: list[str] initialized to an empty list

Algorithm:
1. Read the integers `n` and `k` from input and assign them.
2. Read the string `v` from input.
3. Determine the direction:
   - `f = k - 1 < n - k`
4. Calculate the minimum number of steps to the nearest end:
   - `m = min(k - 1, n - k)`
5. Append direction steps to `a`:
   - For each `i` in range from 0 to `m` (exclusive):
     - Append `d[not f]` to list `a`.
6. For each character `i` in the string `v` traversed in the order determined by `f`:
   - Append `"PRINT " + i` to list `a`.
   - Append `d[f]` to list `a`.
7. Output each element of `a` except the last one, separated by newlines.
