Function: process_input() -> None

Declare variable ABC of type tuple[int]

Execute the following steps:
    1. Read a line of input from the standard input.
    2. Split the input string into a list of substrings using space as a delimiter.
    3. Convert each substring in the list to an integer.
    4. Store the resulting integers as a tuple in the variable ABC.

Conditional structure:
    If the count of the integer 5 in the tuple ABC is equal to 2:
        1. Calculate the sum of all integers in the tuple ABC.
        2. If the sum is equal to 17, output 'YES' to the standard output.
        3. Otherwise, output 'NO' to the standard output.
    Else:
        1. Output 'NO' to the standard output.
