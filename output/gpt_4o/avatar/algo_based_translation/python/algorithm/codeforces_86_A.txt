Function: calculate_maximum_product(l: int, r: int) -> int

Variables:
- curr: int
- s: int
- first: int
- second: int
- ans: int
- rev: str

Logic:
1. curr = r
2. s = 0
3. While curr is not zero:
   a. Increment s by 1
   b. Perform integer division of curr by 10
4. first = 10 raised to the power of s
5. second = first divided by 2
6. ans = -1
7. For each i in [l, r, first, second]:
   a. If i is greater than or equal to l and i is less than or equal to r:
      i. Set curr = i
      ii. Initialize rev as an empty string
      iii. For each character k in the string representation of curr:
          - Append the string of (9 - integer value of k) to rev
      iv. Convert rev to an integer and multiply it by curr
      v. Update ans to be the maximum of ans and the product from step iv
8. Return ans

Input/Output:
- Inputs are two integers read from standard input, separated by space
- The function returns an integer which is printed to standard output

Libraries/Dependencies:
- None
