```
function calculate_steps(n: int, numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    declare l as List[int] and initialize as empty list
    declare ans as int and initialize with n - 1
    declare last as int and initialize with 0

    for each i in numbers:
        append i to l

    for each i in l:
        update ans by adding abs(last - i) + 1
        set last to i

    return ans

declare n as int and set to integer input from user
declare numbers as List[int] and initialize as empty list

for i from 0 to n-1 inclusively:
    append integer input from user to numbers

output result of calculate_steps function with n and numbers as arguments
```
