Function signature:
    function calculate_sum_of_ways(n: int, k: int) -> int

Variable declarations:
    mod: int = 1000000007
    coef: list of int
    nn: int
    dp: list of list of int
    tmp: int

Execution flow:
1. Parse input values for n and k using integer conversion.
2. Initialize an empty list `coef` to store coefficients.
3. Loop `i` from 1 to the integer square root of n (inclusive):
    a. Calculate the difference between integer division of n by i and n by (i + 1).
    b. Append this difference to `coef`.
4. Append (n - sum(coef)) ones to `coef`.
5. Reverse the `coef` list.
6. Set `nn` to the length of `coef`.
7. Initialize a 2D list `dp` of size (k + 1) x `nn` filled with zeros.
8. Set the first element of the first row in `dp` (dp[0][0]) to 1.
9. Loop `i` from 1 to k:
    a. Initialize `tmp` to 0.
    b. Loop `j` from `nn - 1` down to 0:
        i. Increment `tmp` by the value at dp[i - 1][(nn - 1) - j].
        ii. Apply modulo operation to `tmp` with `mod`.
        iii. Set dp[i][j] to the product of coef[j] and `tmp`, then apply modulo operation with `mod`.
10. Calculate the sum of elements in the `k`th row of `dp`, apply modulo operation with `mod`, and return this sum.

I/O operations:
    - Input is read using a single line, split into two integers n and k.
    - Output is the result returned by the function, printed to standard output.

Required libraries or dependencies:
    - None
