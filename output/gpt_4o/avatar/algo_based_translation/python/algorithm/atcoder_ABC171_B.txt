Algorithm:

1. Define a function with no parameters:
   - Function Signature: `def main() -> None`

2. Declare variables:
   - `n`: integer, represents the number of elements in the list
   - `k`: integer, represents the number of smallest elements to sum

3. Input Handling:
   - Read a line of input from standard input, which contains two space-separated integers.
   - Parse the input line to extract two integers `n` and `k`.

4. Declare variable:
   - `numbers`: list of integers, represents the list of numbers to process

5. Input Handling:
   - Read a line of input from standard input, which contains `n` space-separated integers.
   - Convert the input string into a list of integers and store it in `numbers`.

6. Data Processing Logic:
   - Sort the list `numbers` in non-decreasing order.

7. Control Structure:
   - Slice the sorted list to extract the first `k` elements.

8. Data Processing Logic:
   - Calculate the sum of the sliced list, which contains the `k` smallest elements.

9. Output Handling:
   - Print the calculated sum to standard output.

10. Required Libraries:
    - No additional libraries or modules are required.
