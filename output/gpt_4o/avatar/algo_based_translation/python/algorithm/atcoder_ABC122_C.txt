```
Import 'accumulate' function from 'itertools' module

Declare 'n' and 'q' as integers
Read a line of input, split by space, and convert to integers, assign to 'n' and 'q'

Declare 's' as a string
Read a line of input and assign to 's'

Declare 'problems' as a list of lists of integers
For each range from 0 to 'q' (exclusive):
    Read a line of input, split by space, convert to integers, and append to 'problems'

Define function 'count' with parameters 'total' (int), 'i' (int), returns int
    If substring of 's' from index 'i-1' to 'i+1' equals 'AC':
        Return 'total' + 1
    Else:
        Return 'total'

Declare 'cumsum' as a list of integers
Initialize with 'accumulate' function, starting from list [0] followed by range from 1 to 'n'
Use 'count' function as the accumulating function

For each 'l', 'r' in 'problems':
    Calculate 'cumsum[r - 1] - cumsum[l - 1]'
    Output the result
```
