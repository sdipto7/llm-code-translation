Function Signature:
  Function Name: check_lucky_number
  Parameters: None
  Return Type: None

Algorithm:
1. Declare `n` as an integer. Assign it the value obtained from converting input to an integer.
2. Declare `number` as a list of integers. Assign it the result of mapping input string digits to integers.
3. Declare `h1` as an integer and initialize it to 0.
4. Declare `h2` as an integer and initialize it to 0.
5. Declare `x` as an integer and initialize it to 0.
6. Iterate over the range from 0 to `n` using variable `i`:
   a. If `number[i]` is not equal to 4 and `number[i]` is not equal to 7:
      i. Print "NO".
      ii. Increment `x` by 1.
      iii. Break the loop.
   b. If `i` is less than `n // 2`:
      i. Increment `h1` by `number[i]`.
   c. Else:
      i. Increment `h2` by `number[i]`.
7. If `x` is equal to 0:
   a. If `h1` is equal to `h2`:
      i. Print "YES".
   b. Else:
      i. Print "NO".
