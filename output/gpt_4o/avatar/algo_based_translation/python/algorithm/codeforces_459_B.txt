```
Algorithm: ProcessList

Inputs:
  - An integer n
  - A list of integers l1 of size n

Outputs:
  - A tuple containing:
    - An integer representing the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list
    - An integer representing the count of pairs that can be formed based on certain conditions

Variables:
  - n: integer
  - l1: list of integers
  - a: integer
  - b: integer
  - ac: integer
  - bc: integer

Steps:
1. Read an integer from input and assign it to n.
2. Read a line of input, split it into strings, convert each to an integer, and assign the resulting list to l1.
3. Sort the list l1 in non-decreasing order.
4. Assign the last element of l1 to a.
5. Assign the first element of l1 to b.
6. If a is equal to b, then:
   - Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 items from n items, which is n * (n - 1) // 2.
   - Output the tuple (a - b, result from step 6.1).
7. Otherwise:
   - Count the number of occurrences of a in l1 and assign to ac.
   - Count the number of occurrences of b in l1 and assign to bc.
   - Calculate the product of ac and bc.
   - Output the tuple (a - b, result from step 7.3).
