Function signature:
    def transform_string(pya: int, arre: List[str], oString: str, letter1: str) -> str

Variable declarations:
    arre: List[str] - list to store input words
    oString: str - original string to be transformed
    lowString: str - lowercase version of oString
    letter1: str - letter for transformation to lowercase
    letter2: str - alternate letter for transformation if letter1 is 'a'
    valid: List[int] - list of zeros of length of oString
    setcito: Set[int] - set to store indices of characters to transform

Execution logic:
1. Initialize arre as an empty list.
2. While pya is greater than 0, do the following:
    a. Decrement pya by 1.
    b. Append a lowercase input string to arre.
3. Read oString from input.
4. Convert oString to lowercase and store it in lowString.
5. Read the first character of an input string, convert it to lowercase, and assign it to letter1.
6. Assign 'a' to letter2 if letter1 is not 'a', else assign 'b'.
7. Initialize valid as a list of zeros with the same length as oString.
8. Initialize setcito as an empty set.
9. For each string x in arre, do the following:
    a. If x is a substring of lowString, initialize wat to 0.
    b. While True, do the following:
        i. Find the index of x in lowString starting from wat.
        ii. If index is less than 0, break the loop.
        iii. For each index i from index to index + len(x), add i to setcito.
        iv. Update wat to index + 1.
10. Convert oString into a list of characters.
11. For each index i in setcito, do the following:
    a. If lowString[i] is not equal to letter1, assign letter1 to letter.
    b. Otherwise, assign letter2 to letter.
    c. If oString[i] is lowercase, replace it with letter.
    d. Otherwise, replace it with the uppercase version of letter.
12. Print each character in oString list without newline separation.
13. Print a newline character for final output.
