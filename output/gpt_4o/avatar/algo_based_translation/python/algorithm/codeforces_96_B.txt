```
Function: gen(number: int, four: int, seven: int) -> None
    Variables:
        l: list of int
        limit: int = 10000000000
    Logic:
        If number > limit, return from the function
        If number > 0 and four == seven, append number to l
        Call gen with number * 10 + 4, four + 1, seven
        Call gen with number * 10 + 7, four, seven + 1

Function: main() -> None
    Variables:
        l: list of int
        n: int
        ans: int = 0
    Logic:
        Call gen with 0, 0, 0
        Sort list l in-place
        Read integer input from standard input and store in n
        For each val in l:
            If val >= n, set ans = val and break the loop
        Print ans to standard output
