```
Function main() with no parameters and no return type
    Declare integer n, x
    Read integers n and x from input
    Declare list of integers a
    Read list of integers a from input
    Declare 2D list b with dimensions n x n initialized with None values
    For integer i in range from 0 to n-1 inclusive
        Declare integer m and assign a[i] to it
        For integer j in range from 0 to n-1 inclusive
            Declare integer k and calculate k = i - j
            If k is less than 0
                Add n to k
            Reassign m with the minimum of m and a[k]
            Assign m to b[j][i]
    Declare integer m and assign 10^15 to it
    For each index i and list j in enumeration of list b
        Reassign m with the minimum of m and the sum of list j plus x times i
    Print m to output
Call main()
