```
Function: calculate_profit(N: int, V: List[int], C: List[int]) -> int

Variables:
- list: List[int] initialized with [0]
- ans: int initialized to 0
- X: int initialized to 0
- Y: int initialized to 0

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize list as [0].
2. Initialize ans, X, Y to 0.
3. For each index i from 0 to N-1:
   a. If V[i] - C[i] > 0:
      i. Set X to V[i].
      ii. Set Y to C[i].
      iii. Append X - Y to list.
4. Return the sum of all elements in list.

Control Structures:
- For loop iterating over range from 0 to N-1.
- If condition checking if V[i] - C[i] > 0.

Input/Output Operations:
- The function does not perform input/output operations directly.

Data Processing Logic:
- Converts strings to integers for lists V and C.
- Calculates differences between corresponding elements of V and C.
- Appends positive differences to list for summation.

Dependencies:
- The function relies on the List type from the typing module.
