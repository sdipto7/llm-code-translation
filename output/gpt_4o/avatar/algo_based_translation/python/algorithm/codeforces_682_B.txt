Algorithm:

1. Import necessary modules and functions:
   - `import os, sys, io, math`
   - `from array import array`
   - `from math import *`

2. Define lambda functions for input operations:
   - `I`: Function to read a line from standard input, split it by spaces, and convert each part to an integer. Returns a list of integers.
   - `IS`: Function to read a line from standard input and return it as a string.
   - `IN`: Function to read a line from standard input, convert it to an integer, and return it.
   - `IF`: Function to read a line from standard input, convert it to a float, and return it.

3. Variable declarations:
   - `n` (integer): Set to the result of calling `IN()`, which reads an integer from input.
   - `l` (list of integers): Set to the result of calling `I()`, which reads a list of integers from input.
   - `f` (integer): Initialize to 1 (not used in logic).
   - `c` (integer): Initialize to 0.

4. Sort the list `l` in non-decreasing order.

5. Iterate over each element `i` in the sorted list `l`:
   - If `i` is greater than `c`, increment `c` by 1.

6. Output the value of `c + 1` by printing it.
