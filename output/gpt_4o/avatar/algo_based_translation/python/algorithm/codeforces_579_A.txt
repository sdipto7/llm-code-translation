```
Algorithm:
- Import the math module for mathematical operations.
- Declare an integer variable `n` and assign it the integer value from user input.
- Declare an integer variable `x` and initialize it to 1.
- While the logarithm base 2 of `n` is not an integer (i.e., `math.log2(n) % 1` is not zero):
  - Increment the variable `x` by 1.
  - Subtract `2` raised to the power of the integer part of the logarithm base 2 of `n` from `n`.
- Print the value of `x`.
