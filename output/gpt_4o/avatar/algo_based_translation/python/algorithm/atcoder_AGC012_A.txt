```
Import the following modules: 
- median from statistics
- gcd from fractions (note: gcd is deprecated in Python 3 and moved to math.gcd)
- combinations from itertools
- deque from collections
- defaultdict from collections
- bisect
- sys

Set the recursion limit using sys.setrecursionlimit to 10000000.

Define a constant `mod` with the value 10**9 + 7.

Define a function `readInts()` with no parameters:
- Read a line of input using input(), split it into a list of strings, convert each string to an integer using map, and return the list of integers.

Define a function `main()` with no parameters:
- Declare an integer variable `n` and assign it the integer value from input().
- Declare a list `A` and assign it the result of calling `readInts()`.
- Sort the list `A`.
- Declare an integer variable `ans` and initialize it to 0.
- Iterate over the list `A` in reverse order, starting from the second-to-last element and decrementing by 2, until reaching the element at index `len(A) - 2 * n - 1`:
  - Add the current element of `A` to `ans`.
- Print the value of `ans`.

Call the `main()` function if this module is executed as the main program.
