```
Algorithm:
1. Function Signature: main() -> None

2. Variable Declarations:
   - N: int
   - A: List[int]
   - cnt: int
   - i: int
   - d: int

3. Execution Flow:
   a. Read an integer from input and assign it to N.
   b. Initialize an empty list A.
   c. For each integer i from 0 to N-1 (inclusive):
      i.   Read an integer from input, multiply it by N, add i, and append the result to A.
   d. Sort the list A in non-descending order.
   e. Initialize cnt to 0.
   f. For each integer i from 0 to N-1 (inclusive):
      i.   Calculate d as the remainder of the division of A[i] by N, followed by obtaining its remainder when divided by 2.
      ii.  If d modulo 2 is not equal to i modulo 2, increment cnt by 1.
   g. Calculate the integer division of cnt by 2.
   h. Print the result of the division.
