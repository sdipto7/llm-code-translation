```
Algorithm:
1. Function: cal
   - Parameters: s (String), c (char)
   - Return Type: int
   - Variables:
     - n (int): length of s
     - m (int): n - 1
     - ans (int): initialized to 0
   - Logic:
     - Iterate over each character index i in s from 0 to n-1.
       - If s.charAt(i) equals c and (m & i) equals i, toggle ans using XOR with 1.
     - Return ans.

2. Function: solve
   - Parameters: None
   - Return Type: void
   - Variables:
     - n (int): read from input using sc.nextInt()
     - s (String): read from input using sc.next()
     - sb (StringBuilder): initialized as an empty StringBuilder
   - Logic:
     - Iterate from i = 1 to n-1.
       - Append the absolute difference between s.charAt(i) and s.charAt(i-1) to sb.
     - If n equals 2, print sb.charAt(0) and return.
     - Convert sb to a String, assign back to s.
     - If s contains the character '1':
       - Print the result of cal(s, '1').
     - Else:
       - Print the result of cal(s, '2') multiplied by 2.

3. Main Program:
   - Initialize out as a PrintWriter with BufferedOutputStream(System.out).
   - Initialize sc as a new instance of MyScanner.
   - Create a new instance of atcoder_AGC043_B and call the solve method.
   - Close the out PrintWriter.

4. Class: MyScanner
   - Variables:
     - br (BufferedReader): initialized with InputStreamReader(System.in)
     - st (StringTokenizer): initialized as null
   - Methods:
     - next (String):
       - While st is null or !st.hasMoreElements():
         - Read a line from br and assign it to st as a new StringTokenizer.
       - Return the next token from st.
     - nextInt (int): Parse and return the next token as an int.
     - nextLong (long): Parse and return the next token as a long.
     - nextDouble (double): Parse and return the next token as a double.
