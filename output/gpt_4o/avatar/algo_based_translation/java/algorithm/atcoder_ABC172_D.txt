**Algorithm:**

1. Import the required library:
   - `import java.util.Scanner;`

2. Define the main function:
   - `public static void main(String[] args)`

3. Declare and initialize variables:
   - Create a `Scanner` object `sc` to read input.
   - Declare an integer `n` to store the input value.
   - Declare a long integer `ans` and initialize it to 0 to store the final result.

4. Input operation:
   - Read an integer from the input using `sc.nextInt()` and store it in `n`.

5. Logic flow:
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over integers `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive):
     - For each `i`, perform the following calculations:
       - Compute `((long) n / (long) i)` and store it in a temporary variable.
       - Calculate the sum of the arithmetic series:
         - Multiply `i` by the above temporary variable.
         - Multiply the result by `(temporary variable + 1)`.
         - Divide the entire result by 2.
       - Accumulate the result into `ans`.

6. Output operation:
   - Print the value of `ans` to the standard output using `System.out.println(ans);`.
