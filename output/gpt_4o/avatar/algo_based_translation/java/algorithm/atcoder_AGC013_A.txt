```
- Import the Scanner class from the java.util package.
- Define a public class named atcoder_AGC013_A.
- Define the main method with a String array parameter named args.
  - Initialize a Scanner object named stdIn to read from standard input.
  - Declare an integer variable N and assign it the next integer input from stdIn.
  - Declare an integer array A with size N.
  - For each integer i from 0 to N-1, do the following:
    - Assign the next integer input from stdIn to A[i].
  - Declare an integer variable count and initialize it to 0.
  - For each integer i from 0 to N-1, do the following:
    - If i is equal to N-1, increment count by 1.
    - Else if A[i] is equal to A[i+1], do nothing.
    - Else if A[i] is less than A[i+1], do the following:
      - While A[i] is less than or equal to A[i+1], do the following:
        - Increment i by 1.
        - If i is equal to N-1, break the loop.
      - Increment count by 1.
    - Else, do the following:
      - While A[i] is greater than or equal to A[i+1], do the following:
        - Increment i by 1.
        - If i is equal to N-1, break the loop.
      - Increment count by 1.
  - Print the value of count.
