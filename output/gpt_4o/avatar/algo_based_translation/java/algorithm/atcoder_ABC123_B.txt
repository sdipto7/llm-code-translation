- Import Scanner from java.util
- Import TreeMap from java.util

Function main() -> void
    Declare sc as Scanner instance
    Declare array a of integers with size 5
    Declare array r of integers with size 5
    Declare map as TreeMap<Integer, Integer>
    
    For i from 0 to length of a - 1, inclusive
        Set a[i] to the next integer input from sc
        Set r[i] to a[i] modulo 10
        Set b to 10
        If r[i] is not equal to 0
            Set b to 10 minus r[i]
            Add entry to map with b as key and a[i] as value

    Declare ans as integer and set to 0

    If map size is equal to 0
        For i from 0 to length of a - 1, inclusive
            Add a[i] to ans
        Print ans
        Return from function

    Set last to the value in map for the key map.lastKey()
    Declare idx as integer and set to 0

    For i from 0 to length of a - 1, inclusive
        If a[i] is equal to last
            Set idx to i

    For i from 0 to length of a - 1, inclusive
        If i is not equal to idx
            If a[i] modulo 10 is equal to 0
                Add a[i] to ans
            Else
                Add a[i] plus (10 minus r[i]) to ans

    Add last to ans
    Print ans
```
