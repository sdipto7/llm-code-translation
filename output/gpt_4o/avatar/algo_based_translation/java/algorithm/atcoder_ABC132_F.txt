Algorithm atcoder_ABC132_F

1. Import the Scanner class from the java.util package for input operations.

2. Define a constant `mod` of type long with the value 1e9 + 7.

3. Create a Scanner object `sc` to read input from the standard input.

4. Read two integers `n` and `k` using `sc.nextInt()`.

5. Close the Scanner object `sc`.

6. Initialize an ArrayList `len` of Integer type to store segment lengths.

7. Declare an integer `l` and initialize it to 1.

8. While `l` is less than or equal to `n`, execute the following:
   a. Calculate `r` as the integer division of `n` by `(n / l)`.
   b. Add the value `(r - l + 1)` to the ArrayList `len`.
   c. Update `l` to `r + 1`.

9. Calculate and store the size of `len` in an integer `q`.

10. Declare a long array `dp` of size `k * (q + 1)`.

11. Initialize the first row of `dp`:
    a. For `j` from 1 to `q` (inclusive), execute the following:
       i. Set `dp[j]` to the sum of `len.get(j - 1)` and `dp[j - 1]`.

12. Compute the remaining rows of `dp` for each `i` from 1 to `k - 1` (inclusive):
    a. For each `j` from 1 to `q` (inclusive), execute the following:
       i. Set `dp[i * (q + 1) + j]` to the sum of `dp[i * (q + 1) + j - 1]` and the product of `dp[(i - 1) * (q + 1) + q - j + 1]` and `len.get(j - 1)`.
       ii. Take modulo `mod` for `dp[i * (q + 1) + j]`.

13. Print the value of `dp[k * (q + 1) - 1]`.
