Algorithm codeforces_203_B
    Input: None
    Output: Integer

    Import Scanner from java.util

    Function main() -> void
        Declare in as Scanner to read input from system
        Declare N as integer, assign in.nextInt() (input from user)
        Declare M as integer, assign in.nextInt() (input from user)
        Declare black as 2D integer array with dimensions [N+2][N+2], initialized to 0

        For m from 1 to M, inclusive
            Declare x as integer, assign in.nextInt() (input from user)
            Declare y as integer, assign in.nextInt() (input from user)
            
            For xx from x-1 to x+1, inclusive
                For yy from y-1 to y+1, inclusive
                    Increment black[xx][yy] by 1
                    If black[xx][yy] equals 9
                        Output m
                        Return from function

        Output "-1"
