```
Function: main()
  Dependencies:
    - Import Scanner from java.util
    - Import Arrays.sort from java.util
    - Import Math from java.lang for static methods (though not used)
  
  Variables:
    - sc: Scanner instance for input
    - n: integer, number of groups of three numbers (input)
    - array: array of integers with length 3 * n
    - head: integer, index for accessing array
    - res: long, stores the result of the sum

  Execution Flow:
    1. Create a Scanner object to read input.
    2. Read an integer n from input, which represents the number of groups.
    3. Declare an integer array of size 3 * n.
    4. Iterate over the array indices from 0 to 3 * n - 1:
       - Read an integer from input and assign it to the current index of array.
    5. Sort the array in non-decreasing order using Arrays.sort method.
    6. Initialize head to the second last index of the array (3 * n - 2).
    7. Initialize res to 0 to store the sum of selected numbers.
    8. Iterate n times:
       - Add the value at index head of the array to res.
       - Decrement head by 2 to skip to the next appropriate index.
    9. Print the value of res to the standard output.
