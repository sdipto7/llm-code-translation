Algorithm FindDivisorsSequence
  Input: An integer n
  Output: A sequence of integers starting from n where each subsequent integer is a divisor of the previous one

  Variables:
    n: Integer
    m: Integer
    i: Integer

  Begin
    Read integer n from standard input
    Print n followed by a space to standard output
    Set m to n

    For i from n - 1 down to 1 do
      If m modulo i equals 0 then
        Print i followed by a space to standard output
        Set m to i
      End If
    End For
  End
