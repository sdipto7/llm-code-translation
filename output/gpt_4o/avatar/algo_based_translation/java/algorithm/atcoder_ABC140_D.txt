Algorithm:

1. Import the `java.util.Scanner` for input operations.

2. Define the main function:
   - Input: No parameters
   - Output: None (prints result to console)

3. Initialize a `Scanner` object to read input.

4. Read and parse the following inputs:
   - Integer `N` from input (number of characters in string)
   - Integer `K` from input (maximum number of operations)
   - String `S` from input (initial string of 'L' and 'R' characters)

5. Convert the string `S` to two character arrays `c1` and `c3`.

6. Initialize a boolean `flag` to `false` and an integer `count` to `0`.

7. Process the character array `c1`:
   - Iterate over each character from `0` to `N-1`:
     - If `flag` is `true` and current character is 'R':
       - Set `flag` to `false`
       - Increment `count`
     - If `count` equals `K`, break the loop.
     - If current character is 'L':
       - Set `flag` to `true`
       - Change current character to 'R'

8. Reset `flag` to `false` and `count` to `0`.

9. Process the character array `c3`:
   - Iterate over each character from `0` to `N-1`:
     - If `flag` is `true` and current character is 'L':
       - Set `flag` to `false`
       - Increment `count`
     - If `count` equals `K`, break the loop.
     - If current character is 'R':
       - Set `flag` to `true`
       - Change current character to 'L'

10. Convert `c1` and `c3` back to strings `S1` and `S3`.

11. Initialize `count` to `1` and `sum1` to `0`.

12. Calculate `sum1` based on `S1`:
    - Set `bef` to the first character of `S1`.
    - Iterate over each character from `1` to `N-1`:
      - If current character equals `bef`:
        - Increment `count`
        - If current index is `N-1`, add `count-1` to `sum1`.
      - Else:
        - Set `bef` to current character
        - Add `count-1` to `sum1`
        - Reset `count` to `1`

13. Initialize `count` to `1` and `sum3` to `0`.

14. Calculate `sum3` based on `S3`:
    - Set `bef` to the first character of `S3`.
    - Iterate over each character from `1` to `N-1`:
      - If current character equals `bef`:
        - Increment `count`
        - If current index is `N-1`, add `count-1` to `sum3`.
      - Else:
        - Set `bef` to current character
        - Add `count-1` to `sum3`
        - Reset `count` to `1`

15. Output the maximum value between `sum1` and `sum3` to the console.
