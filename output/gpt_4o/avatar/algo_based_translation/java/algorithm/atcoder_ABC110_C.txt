Algorithm atcoder_ABC110_C
  Input: None
  Output: Prints "Yes" or "No"

  Declare a Scanner object `sc` to read input from the standard input
  Read a line from input and store it as String `S`
  Read a line from input and store it as String `T`
  Close the Scanner object `sc`

  Declare a String array `A` containing all lowercase alphabets from "a" to "z"
  Declare a boolean variable `res` and initialize it to true

  For each `s` in array `A`
    Find the first occurrence index `sIdx` of `s` in `S`
    If `sIdx` is less than 0, continue to the next iteration

    Convert the character at position `sIdx` in `T` to a String `t`
    Initialize an integer `idx` to 0

    While `idx` is less than the length of `S`
      If `s` is found in `S` starting from index `idx`
        If the index of `s` in `S` does not match the index of `t` in `T` starting from `idx`
          Set `res` to false
          Break the loop
        Else
          Update `idx` to the index of `s` in `S` plus 1
      Else if `t` is found in `T` starting from index `idx`
        Set `res` to false
        Break the loop
      Else
        Break the loop

    If `res` is false, break the outer loop

  If `res` is true, print "Yes"
  Else, print "No"
