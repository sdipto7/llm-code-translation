1. **Function Signature**
   - `main(String[] args): void`

2. **Variable Declarations**
   - `in: Scanner` - Used to read input from the console.
   - `n: int` - The number of elements in the sequence.
   - `d: int` - The increment value to ensure the sequence is strictly increasing.
   - `nums: int[]` - An array of integers of size `n` to store the sequence.
   - `result: int` - A counter to store the minimum number of operations needed.
   - `a: int` - A temporary variable used to calculate the difference between consecutive elements.

3. **Execution Logic**
   - Initialize `Scanner` object `in` to read input.
   - Read an integer from input and assign to `n`.
   - Read an integer from input and assign to `d`.
   - Create an array `nums` of size `n`.
   - For `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
     - Read an integer from input and assign to `nums[i]`.
   - Initialize `result` to `0`.
   - Initialize `a` to `0`.
   - For `i` from `1` to `n-1`:
     - Calculate `a` as `nums[i-1] - nums[i]`.
     - If `a >= 0`:
       - Increment `result` by `(a / d) + 1`.
       - Increment `nums[i]` by `((a / d) + 1) * d`.
   - Output the value of `result`.

4. **Control Structures**
   - A `for` loop iterating over the range from `0` to `n-1` for reading input into `nums`.
   - Another `for` loop iterating over the range from `1` to `n-1` to process the array and ensure it is strictly increasing.
   - An `if` conditional statement to check if the current element is less than or equal to the previous element and adjust it accordingly.

5. **Input/Output Operations**
   - Use `Scanner` for reading input values for `n`, `d`, and each element of the array `nums`.
   - Use `System.out.println` to output the final result stored in `result`.

6. **Dependencies**
   - `java.util.Scanner` for reading input from the console.
