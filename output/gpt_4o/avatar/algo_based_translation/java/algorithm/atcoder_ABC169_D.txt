Algorithm atcoder_ABC169_D:
    Input: None (reads from standard input)
    Output: Prints an integer to standard output

    Initialize:
        Import Scanner from java.util
        Create a Scanner object to read standard input
        Declare long integer 'n' and assign the next long input value from the scanner
        Declare integer 'sqrt' and assign the integer square root of 'n'
        Declare integer 'answer' and initialize to 0

    Loop through integers from 2 to 'sqrt' (inclusive):
        For each integer 'i':
            Declare integer 'count' and initialize to 0

            While 'n' modulo 'i' equals 0:
                Divide 'n' by 'i' and assign the result back to 'n'
                Increment 'count' by 1

            For integer 'j' starting from 1, incrementing by 1:
                While 'count' minus 'j' is greater than or equal to 0:
                    Subtract 'j' from 'count'
                    Increment 'answer' by 1

    If 'n' is greater than 1:
        Increment 'answer' by 1

    Print the value of 'answer'
