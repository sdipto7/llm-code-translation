```plaintext
Function signature:
- main(): void

Variable declarations and data types:
- sc: Scanner
- Q, H, S, D, N, onePrice: long

Execution order and logic flow:
1. Initialize Scanner to read input from the standard input stream.
2. Read five long integers Q, H, S, D, and N from input using the Scanner.

Control structures:
- Calculate onePrice:
  - Compute the minimum of:
    - Q multiplied by 4
    - H multiplied by 2
    - S
  - Assign the result to onePrice.
  
- Conditional check:
  - If onePrice is less than or equal to D divided by 2 (converted to double for accurate floating-point comparison):
    - Output the product of N and onePrice.
  - Else:
    - Output the sum of:
      - N divided by 2, multiplied by D
      - N modulo 2, multiplied by onePrice

Input/output operations:
- Use Scanner for reading input.
- Use System.out.println for outputting results.

Required libraries:
- java.util.Scanner
- java.lang.System (implicitly used for standard input/output)
```
