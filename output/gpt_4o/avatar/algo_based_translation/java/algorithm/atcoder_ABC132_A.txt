1. Import the necessary libraries: `java.util.HashMap`, `java.util.Map.Entry`, and `java.util.Scanner`.

2. Define the main function: `public static void main(String[] args)`

3. Declare and initialize a `Scanner` object `in` to read input from the standard input stream.

4. Read a string `s` from input using `in.next()`, which is expected to be a string of length 4.

5. Convert the string `s` into a character array `targ` using `s.toCharArray()`.

6. Declare a `HashMap<Character, Integer>` named `map`.

7. Iterate over each character in the `targ` array using a for loop with index `i` ranging from 0 to `targ.length - 1`:
   - If the character `targ[i]` is not already in `map`, add it with a value of 1.
   - If the character `targ[i]` is already present in `map`, increment its value by 1.

8. Declare a boolean variable `ok` and initialize it to `true`.

9. Iterate over each entry `c` in the `map` using a for-each loop:
   - If the value associated with the entry `c` is not equal to 2, set `ok` to `false` and break out of the loop.

10. Check if `ok` is `true` and the size of `map` is 2:
    - If both conditions are met, print "Yes".
    - Otherwise, print "No".

11. Close the `Scanner` object `in` using `in.close()`.
