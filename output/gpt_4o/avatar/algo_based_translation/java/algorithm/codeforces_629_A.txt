1. Import the `java.util.*` library.
2. Define the main function `public static void main(String[] args)`.
3. Declare a `Scanner` object `sc` to read input from the standard input.
4. Read an integer `num` from input using `sc.nextInt()` which represents the number of rows and columns of an NxN grid.
5. Declare an integer `counter` initialized to 0.
6. Declare an integer `fine` initialized to 0.
7. Declare an `ArrayList<String>` named `arr` to store the strings representing the grid rows.
8. Loop `i` from 0 to `num - 1`:
   - Read a string `s` using `sc.next()` and add it to `arr`.
9. Loop `i` from 0 to `num - 1`:
   - Set `counter` to 0.
   - Loop `k` from 0 to `num - 1`:
     - If the character at position `i` in the `k`-th string of `arr` is 'C', increment `counter` by 1.
   - Increment `fine` by `(counter * (counter - 1)) / 2`.
10. Loop `i` from 0 to `num - 1`:
    - Set `counter` to 0.
    - Loop `k` from 0 to `num - 1`:
      - If the character at position `k` in the `i`-th string of `arr` is 'C', increment `counter` by 1.
    - Increment `fine` by `(counter * (counter - 1)) / 2`.
11. Print the value of `fine`.
