```
Algorithm: FindNextPrime

Function Signature:
- Input: None
- Output: None

Variable Declarations:
- stdIn: Scanner (for reading input)
- x: Integer (to store the input number)
- sqrtNum: Double (to store the square root of x)
- i: Integer (loop counter for checking divisibility)

Logic Flow:
1. Initialize stdIn to read input from the standard input.
2. Read the next token from stdIn, parse it as an integer, and assign it to x.
3. If x is not equal to 2 and x is even, increment x by 1.
4. Start an infinite loop.
   a. Compute the square root of x and assign it to sqrtNum.
   b. Initialize i to 3.
   c. Start a loop where i increments by 2 each iteration.
      i. Check if i is less than or equal to sqrtNum.
      ii. If x is divisible by i, break the loop.
   d. If i is greater than sqrtNum, break the infinite loop.
   e. Increment x by 2.
5. Output the value of x.
