```
Algorithm:
1. Import the Scanner class from the java.util package.
2. Define the main function with no parameters and no return type.
3. Declare a Scanner object `s` to read input from the standard input stream.
4. Read an integer `n` from input using `s.nextInt()`.
5. Declare an integer array `dp` of size 200001.
6. Execute a for loop with integer `i` starting from 0, running while `i` is less than `n`, incrementing `i` by 1 after each iteration:
   - Read an integer from input using `s.nextInt()`.
   - Assign the value of `i` to `dp` at the index of the read integer.
7. Declare a long integer `ans` and initialize it to 0.
8. Execute a for loop with integer `i` starting from 2, running while `i` is less than or equal to `n`, incrementing `i` by 1 after each iteration:
   - Add the absolute difference between `dp[i]` and `dp[i-1]` to `ans`.
9. Output the value of `ans` to the standard output stream.
