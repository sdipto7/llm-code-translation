Algorithm codeforces_450_A:
  Input: None (reads from standard input)
  Output: Integer (prints to standard output)
  
  Declare 'sc' as a Scanner object
  Read integer 'n' from 'sc'
  Read integer 'm' from 'sc'
  
  Declare 'q1' as a Queue of Integer
  Declare 'q2' as a Queue of Integer
  
  For 'i' from 1 to 'n' inclusive:
    Read an integer from 'sc' and add it to 'q1'
    Add 'i' to 'q2'
  
  Initialize 'ans' as 0
  
  While 'q1' is not empty:
    If the element at the front of 'q1' is less than or equal to 'm':
      Remove the element from the front of 'q1'
      Set 'ans' to the element removed from the front of 'q2'
    Else if the element at the front of 'q1' is greater than 'm':
      Remove the element from the front of 'q1' and store it in 'x'
      Calculate 'val' as 'x' minus 'm'
      Add 'val' to the end of 'q1'
      Remove the element from the front of 'q2' and store it in 'val2'
      Add 'val2' to the end of 'q2'
  
  Print 'ans'
