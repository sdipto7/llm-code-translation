Function: run()
    Declare constant MOD as long with value 1000000007
    Create Scanner object sc for standard input
    Read a string from input and convert to character array cs
    Initialize a 2D array dp of type long with dimensions [cs.length][13]
    Initialize integer base to 1
    For integer i from 0 to cs.length - 1, inclusive:
        If character cs[cs.length - 1 - i] is '?':
            For integer pre from 0 to 12, inclusive:
                For integer next from 0 to 9, inclusive:
                    Update dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] by adding 
                    (if i > 0 then dp[i - 1][pre] else (if pre == 0 then 1 else 0))
                    Take modulo MOD after addition
        Else:
            Calculate integer next as cs[cs.length - 1 - i] - '0'
            For integer pre from 0 to 12, inclusive:
                Update dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] by adding
                (if i > 0 then dp[i - 1][pre] else (if pre == 0 then 1 else 0))
                Take modulo MOD after addition
        Update base as (base * 10) modulo 13
    Print dp[dp.length - 1][5]
