Algorithm atcoder_ABC164_A
  Input: None
  Output: Prints "unsafe" or "safe" based on the relationship between Sheep and Wolve

  Dependencies:
    Import Scanner class from java.util package
    Import ArrayList class from java.util package

  Variable Declarations:
    scan: Scanner - a Scanner object for reading input
    scList: ArrayList<String> - a list to store input lines
    numlist: Array of String - to store split values of the first line of input
    Sheep: Integer - to store the number of Sheep
    Wolve: Integer - to store the number of Wolves

  Begin
    Initialize scan as a new Scanner object using System.in
    Initialize scList as a new ArrayList of Strings

    Loop: Infinite loop (for i = 0; i >= 0; i++)
      Try
        Read a line from input using scan.nextLine()
        Add the line to scList
      Catch Exception
        Break the loop

    numlist ← Split the first element of scList by space character

    Sheep ← Convert numlist[0] to Integer
    Wolve ← Convert numlist[1] to Integer

    If Wolve >= Sheep Then
      Print "unsafe"
    Else
      Print "safe"
    End If
  End
```
