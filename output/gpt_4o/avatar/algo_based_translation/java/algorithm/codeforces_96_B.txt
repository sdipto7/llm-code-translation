```
Dependencies:
- Import the Scanner class from the java.util package

Algorithm:
- Define the main function: `public static void main(String[] args)`
  - Declare a Scanner object `in` to read input from the standard input
  - Declare a long variable `number` and initialize it with the next long value from the input
  - Declare a long variable `ans` and initialize it to -1
  - Declare a long variable `value` and initialize it to 0
  - Declare an integer variable `mask` and initialize it to 2
  - Start a while loop with the condition `value < number`
    - Convert `mask` to its binary string representation using `Integer.toBinaryString(mask)`
    - Increment `mask` by 1
    - Remove the first character from the binary string using `substring(1)`
    - Assign the result to a string variable `s`
    - Declare an integer variable `zeros` and initialize it to 0
    - For each character `c` in the character array of the string `s`
      - If `c` is equal to '0', increment `zeros` by 1
    - If `zeros` is not equal to the length of `s` minus `zeros`, continue to the next iteration of the loop
    - Replace all occurrences of '0' in `s` with '4'
    - Replace all occurrences of '1' in `s` with '7'
    - Parse `s` as a long integer and assign it to `value`
  - Print `value` to the standard output
```
