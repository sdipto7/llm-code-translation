Function Signature:
- `main(String[] args)`: void

Variables:
- `BufferedReader bf`: BufferedReader
- `String[] x`: String array
- `int a`: Integer
- `int b`: Integer
- `int c`: Integer

Algorithm:
1. Initialize a `BufferedReader` object `bf` to read input from the standard input stream.
2. Read a line of input using `bf.readLine()`, trim any leading/trailing whitespace, and split the line by spaces into a `String` array `x`.
3. Parse the first element of `x` as an integer and assign it to variable `a`.
4. Parse the second element of `x` as an integer and assign it to variable `b`.
5. Calculate `c` as `a - b * 2`.
6. If `c` is less than 0, set `c` to 0.
7. Print the value of `c` to the standard output.
8. Handle any exceptions that may occur during the process with a try-catch block, but do not perform any action in the catch block.
