Algorithm codeforces_8_B

Dependencies:
- Import Scanner from java.util

Variables:
- Scanner scan: to read input
- int i, j, x = 0, y = 0, k = 0, dx, dy: loop counters and coordinate variables
- boolean flag = true: to track if a bug is detected
- String s: to store the input string
- char[] ch: character array of size 100 to store the moves
- int[][] co: 2D integer array with dimensions [2][101] to store coordinates

Procedure:
1. Initialize Scanner object to read input
2. Read a string s from input
3. Convert string s to a character array ch
4. Initialize starting coordinates (x, y) and store in co[0][k] and co[1][k], increment k
5. Iterate over each character in string s from index 0 to s.length()-1
   a. Switch on current character ch[i]
      i. Case 'L': Decrement x
      ii. Case 'R': Increment x
      iii. Case 'U': Increment y
      iv. Case 'D': Decrement y
   b. Store updated coordinates (x, y) in co[0][k] and co[1][k], increment k
6. Iterate i from 0 to k-3
   a. Iterate j from i+3 to k
      i. Calculate dx as the absolute difference between co[0][i] and co[0][j]
      ii. Calculate dy as the absolute difference between co[1][i] and co[1][j]
      iii. If (dx <= 1 and dy == 0) or (dy <= 1 and dx == 0), set flag to false and break inner loop
   b. If flag is false, break outer loop
7. If flag is true, print "OK"
8. Else, print "BUG"
