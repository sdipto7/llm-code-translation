Algorithm Codeforces617B
  Input: An integer n followed by n integers
  
  Function main() -> void
    Declare input as Scanner initialized with System input
    Declare n as Integer
    Set n to the next integer from input
    Declare arr as List of Integer
    Initialize arr as an empty ArrayList
    
    For each integer i from 0 to n-1 (inclusive)
      If the next integer from input equals 1
        Add i to arr
    
    If arr is empty
      Output 0
    Else
      Declare result as Long
      Set result to 1
      
      For each integer i from 1 to the size of arr - 1 (inclusive)
        Set result to result multiplied by (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])
      
      Output result
