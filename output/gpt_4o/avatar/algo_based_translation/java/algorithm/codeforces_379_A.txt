Algorithm:
1. Import necessary dependencies:
   - Import the `java.util.Scanner` class for input operations.

2. Define the main function:
   - Signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`

3. Declare variables:
   - `Scanner scan` to read input from the standard input.
   - `int a` to store the initial number of candles.
   - `int b` to store the number of burnt-out candles needed to form a new candle.
   - `int res` to store the total number of candles that can be burnt.

4. Initialize the scanner:
   - `scan = new Scanner(System.in)`

5. Read inputs:
   - Assign `a` the value from `scan.nextInt()`.
   - Assign `b` the value from `scan.nextInt()`.

6. Initialize result:
   - Assign `a` to `res` to include the initial candles in the total count.

7. Loop to calculate the total number of candles that can be burnt:
   - While `a` is greater than or equal to `b`:
     - Add the integer division of `a` by `b` to `res`.
     - Update `a` to the sum of the integer division of `a` by `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.

8. Output the result:
   - Print the value of `res`.
