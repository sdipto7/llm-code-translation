1. Read integer N from input
2. Read N space-separated integers into array A
3. Initialize result to 0
4. For b from 0 to 59
   4.1 Calculate bs as the sum of (A shifted right by b bits and bitwise AND with 1)
   4.2 Update result to (result + bs * (N - bs) * (2 raised to the power of b)) modulo 1000000007
5. Output result
