1. Read input (not used)
2. Read a list of space-separated integers and corresponding characters
3. Create a tuple of pairs (integer, character) from the input
4. Calculate initial score for 'B' pieces
5. Initialize variables: pScore, sScore, pMaxScore, sMaxScore with the initial 'B' score
6. Iterate through the tuple of pairs from left to right
   1. If the character is 'A', add the integer to pScore
   2. If pScore is greater than pMaxScore, update pMaxScore
   3. If the character is 'B', subtract the integer from pScore
7. Iterate through the tuple of pairs from right to left
   1. If the character is 'A', add the integer to sScore
   2. If sScore is greater than sMaxScore, update sMaxScore
   3. If the character is 'B', subtract the integer from sScore
8. Compare pMaxScore and sMaxScore
9. Return the maximum of pMaxScore and sMaxScore
10. Print the result of the main function if the script is run directly.
