1. READ input into variable I
2. PARSE I into two integers n and m
3. INITIALIZE array b of size 2n with all elements set to 1
4. SET b[0], b[n-1], b[n], and b[2n-1] to 0
5. LOOP m times:
   1. READ input into variables r and c
   2. SET b[r-1] and b[n+c-1] to 0
6. IF n is odd and b[n/2] is 1 and b[n+n/2] is 1:
   1. SET b[n/2] to 0
7. CALCULATE sum of all elements in array b
8. OUTPUT the sum
