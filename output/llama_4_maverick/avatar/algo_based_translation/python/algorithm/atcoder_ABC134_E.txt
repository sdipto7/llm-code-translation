1. Define a function binary_search(key)
    1.1 Initialize bad to -1 and good to length of ans
    1.2 While good - bad is greater than 1
        1.2.1 Calculate mid as the average of bad and good
        1.2.2 If last element of ans[mid] is less than key
            1.2.2.1 Set good to mid
        1.2.3 Else
            1.2.3.1 Set bad to mid
    1.3 Return good

2. Read N as an integer input
3. Initialize ans as an empty list
4. For N iterations
    4.1 Read A as an integer input
    4.2 Calculate idx using binary_search(A)
    4.3 If idx is equal to the length of ans
        4.3.1 Append a new list containing A to ans
    4.4 Else
        4.4.1 Append A to the list at ans[idx]
5. Print the length of ans
