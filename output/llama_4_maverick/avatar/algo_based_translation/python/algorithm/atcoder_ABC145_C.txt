1. Import necessary modules
2. Define function solve with parameters N, x, and y
   1. Generate indices from 0 to N-1
   2. Compute all permutations of the indices
   3. Initialize an empty list distances
   4. For each permutation
      1. Initialize total_distance to 0
      2. For i from 0 to N-2
         1. Extract the i-th and (i+1)-th elements from the permutation
         2. Calculate the distance between the corresponding points (x, y)
         3. Add the distance to total_distance
      3. Append total_distance to distances
   5. Calculate the average of the distances
   6. Print the average distance
3. Define function main
   1. Define a generator function iterate_tokens to read input tokens
   2. Initialize tokens using iterate_tokens
   3. Read N from the tokens
   4. Initialize lists x and y of size N
   5. Read coordinates into x and y
   6. Call solve with N, x, and y
4. If the script is run as the main module, call main
