1. Read integer n from input
2. Read n integers from input and store them in array arr
3. If arr[0] is greater than 15 then
    4. Output 15
else
    5. Iterate from i = 1 to length of arr
    6. If difference between arr[i] and arr[i-1] is greater than 15 then
        7. Output arr[i-1] + 15
        8. Exit loop
    9. If loop completes without exiting then
        10. If arr[-1] is equal to 90 or arr[-1] + 15 is greater than or equal to 90 then
            11. Output 90
        else
            12. Output arr[-1] + 15
