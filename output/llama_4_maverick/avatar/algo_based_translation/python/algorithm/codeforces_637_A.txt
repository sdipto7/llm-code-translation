1. Read integer n from input
2. Read string s from input, split it into a list of words, and remove the last character
3. Count the frequency of each word in the list using a Counter data structure
4. Reverse the order of the list of words
5. Initialize variable c to -1 and variable a to 0
6. Iterate over each unique word in the Counter data structure
7. Check if the frequency of the current word is equal to the maximum frequency
8. If true, check if the index of the current word in the reversed list is greater than c
9. If true, update a to the current word and c to the index of the current word
10. Print the value of a
