1. Import the gcd function from the fractions module
2. Define a function lcm(a, b) that returns the least common multiple of a and b
3. Set MOD to 10^9 + 7
4. Read the integer N from input
5. Read N integers into a list A
6. Initialize _lcm to 1
7. For each element a in A:
   7.1. Update _lcm to be the least common multiple of _lcm and a
8. Calculate the sum of the modular multiplicative inverses of elements in A modulo MOD
9. Compute ans as the product of _lcm and the sum calculated in step 8, modulo MOD
10. Output ans modulo MOD as an integer
