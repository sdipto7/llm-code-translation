1. Read integer n from input
2. Read n integers from input and store in list l1
3. Sort list l1 in ascending order
4. Assign the last element of l1 to variable a
5. Assign the first element of l1 to variable b
6. If a equals b then
   6.1. Calculate count = n * (n - 1) / 2
   6.2. Print 0, count
7. Else
   7.1. Count occurrences of a in l1 and store in ac
   7.2. Count occurrences of b in l1 and store in bc
   7.3. Calculate product = ac * bc
   7.4. Print a - b, product
