1. Define a list of input methods: ['clipboard', 'file', 'key']
2. Initialize the using method index to 0
3. Determine the input method based on the using method index
4. Define a lambda function IN to map input to integers split by spaces
5. Set the modulus value to 1000000007
6. Define a function main_b:
   1. Read input string s
   2. Initialize variables pp to 0 and na to 0
   3. Iterate through the characters of s in reverse order
   4. For each character c, calculate cc = na + integer value of c
   5. Reset na to 0
   6. If cc <= 4, increment pp by cc
   7. Otherwise, set na to 1 and increment pp by 10 - cc
   8. If it's the last character and na is 1, increment pp by 1
   9. Print pp
7. Define a function main:
   1. Read input string s
   2. Initialize pmin to 1000 and mmin to 0
   3. Prepend '0' to s
   4. Iterate through the characters of s in reverse order
   5. For each character c, calculate its integer value v
   6. Update npmin and nmmin based on pmin, mmin, and v
   7. Update pmin and mmin with npmin and nmmin
   8. Return the minimum of pmin and mmin
8. Define a flag isTest and initialize it to False
9. Define a function pa to print value v if isTest is True
10. Define a function input_clipboard to read input from the clipboard
11. In the main block:
    1. Check if the platform is 'ios'
    2. If 'ios', check the input method and configure input accordingly
    3. Set isTest to True if 'ios'
    4. Call the main function and store the result in ret
    5. If ret is not None, print ret
