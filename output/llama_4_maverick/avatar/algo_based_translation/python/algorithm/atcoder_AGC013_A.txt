1. Initialize N by reading an integer from input.
2. Read a list of N integers into array A.
3. Group consecutive equal elements in A and store the result back in A.
4. Update N to be the length of the new A.
5. Initialize a variable i to 1 and ans to 0.
6. While i is less than N - 1:
   6.1. Check if the element at index i is a peak (A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1]) or a trough (A[i-1] > A[i] < A[i+1]).
   6.2. If the condition is true, increment ans by 1 and i by 1.
   6.3. Increment i by 1.
7. Print ans + 1.
