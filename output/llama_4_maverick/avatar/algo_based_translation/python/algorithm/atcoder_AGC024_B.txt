1. Read N from input
2. Read N integers into array P
3. If N equals 1 then
   1. Print 0
   2. Return
4. Create array a of size N + 1 and initialize all elements to 0
5. For i from 0 to N - 1
   1. Set a[P[i]] to i
6. Initialize tmp to 1 and max_len to 1
7. For i from 1 to N - 1
   1. If a[i] is less than a[i + 1] then
      1. Increment tmp by 1
      2. Set max_len to maximum of max_len and tmp
   2. Else
      1. Set tmp to 1
8. Calculate ans as N - max_len
9. Print ans
