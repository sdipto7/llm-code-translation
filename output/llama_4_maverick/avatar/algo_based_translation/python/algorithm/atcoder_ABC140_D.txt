1. Initialize MOD to 10^9 + 7
2. Read N and K from input
3. Read string S from input
4. Initialize seg_cnt to 0
5. For i from 0 to N-2
   5.1 If S[i] is not equal to S[i+1]
      5.1.1 Increment seg_cnt by 1
6. Calculate cur_happy as N - 1 - seg_cnt
7. If 2 * K is greater than or equal to seg_cnt
   7.1 Set ans to N - 1
8. Else
   8.1 Set ans to cur_happy + 2 * K
9. Print ans
