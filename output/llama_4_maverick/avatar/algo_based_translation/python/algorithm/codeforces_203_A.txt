1. INPUT x, t, a, b, da, db from user input split by spaces
2. CONVERT x, t, a, b, da, db to integers
3. IF x equals 0 THEN
   4. PRINT "YES"
   5. EXIT with "Result Found"
6. CALCULATE a_time as minimum of (a divided by da) and (t - 1)
7. CALCULATE b_time as minimum of (b divided by db) and (t - 1)
8. FOR i from 0 to a_time
   9. FOR j from 0 to b_time
      10. IF (a - da * i) equals x OR (b - db * j) equals x THEN
         11. PRINT "YES"
         12. EXIT with "Result Found"
      13. IF (a - da * i) + (b - db * j) equals x THEN
         14. PRINT "YES"
         15. EXIT with "Result Found"
16. EXIT with "Result Not Found"
17. IF result is "Result Not Found" THEN
   18. PRINT "NO"
