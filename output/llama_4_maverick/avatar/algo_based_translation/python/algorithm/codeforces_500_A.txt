1. Read two integers n and t from input
2. Read a list s of n integers from input
3. Initialize current_cell to 0
4. While current_cell is less than or equal to t
   4.1. Increment current_cell by the value at index (current_cell - 1) in list s
   4.2. If current_cell equals t
      4.2.1. Output "YES"
      4.2.2. Terminate the program
   4.3. Otherwise, continue to the next iteration
5. Output "NO"
