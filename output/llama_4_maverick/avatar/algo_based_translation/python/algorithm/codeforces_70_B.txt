1. Read an integer n from input
2. Initialize ans to 1 and sumL to 0
3. Read a string from input and split it into sentences using [.?!] as delimiters
4. For each sentence s in the split string
   1. Strip leading and trailing whitespace from s and append a '.'
   2. Calculate the length L of the modified s
   3. If L is greater than 1
      1. If L is greater than n
         1. Output "Impossible" and exit
      2. If sumL + L + (1 if sumL > 0 else 0) is greater than n
         1. Increment ans by 1
         2. Set sumL to L
      3. Else
         1. Increment sumL by L + (1 if sumL > 0 else 0)
5. Output ans
