1. Define function solve with parameters H, W, A, B
   1.1 Initialize a 2D array answer of size H x W with all elements as "0"
   1.2 Iterate over each row i from 0 to H-1
      1.2.1 Iterate over each column j from 0 to W-1
         1.2.1.1 If i is less than B
            1.2.1.1.1 If j is less than A
               1.2.1.1.1.1 Set answer[i][j] to "0"
            1.2.1.1.2 Else
               1.2.1.1.2.1 Set answer[i][j] to "1"
         1.2.1.2 Else
            1.2.1.2.1 If j is less than A
               1.2.1.2.1.1 Set answer[i][j] to "1"
            1.2.1.2.2 Else
               1.2.1.2.2.1 Set answer[i][j] to "0"
   1.3 Iterate over each row i from 0 to H-1
      1.3.1 Print the elements of answer[i] as a concatenated string

2. Define function main
   2.1 Define function iterate_tokens
      2.1.1 Iterate over each line in the standard input
         2.1.1.1 Iterate over each word in the line split by spaces
            2.1.1.1.1 Yield the word
   2.2 Initialize tokens as the result of iterate_tokens
   2.3 Read H, W, A, B from tokens as integers
   2.4 Call solve with H, W, A, B

3. If the script is being run as the main module
   3.1 Call main
