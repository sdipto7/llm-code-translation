1. Read two integer inputs and store them in variables a and b.
2. Initialize a variable c to 0.
3. Repeat the following steps 2 times:
   3.1. Update c by adding the maximum of a and b to it.
   3.2. If a is greater than or equal to b, decrement a by 1.
   3.3. Otherwise, decrement b by 1.
4. Output the value of c.
