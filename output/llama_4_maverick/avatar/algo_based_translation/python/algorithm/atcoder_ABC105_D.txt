1. Import necessary inputs N and M from standard input, parsing them as integers.
2. Import array A from standard input, parsing its elements as integers.
3. Calculate cumulative remainders by:
   1. Prepending 0 to array A.
   2. Computing the remainder of each element when divided by M.
   3. Calculating the cumulative sum of these remainders.
   4. Computing the remainder of the cumulative sum when divided by M.
4. Count occurrences of each remainder in the cumulative remainders.
5. Initialize a variable to store the total count of combinations.
6. For each count of remainder occurrences:
   1. Calculate the number of combinations using the formula count * (count - 1) / 2.
   2. Add this to the total count of combinations.
7. Output the total count of combinations.
