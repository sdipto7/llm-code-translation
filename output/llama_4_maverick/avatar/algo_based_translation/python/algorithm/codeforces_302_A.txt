1. Read two integers n and m from input
2. Calculate sa as the minimum between the count of '-' in the input string and n minus the count of '-'
3. Initialize an empty list ss
4. Repeat the following steps m times:
   4.1 Read two integers a and b from input
   4.2 Calculate b as (b - a) modulo 2
   4.3 Check if b is odd and less than or equal to 2 times sa
   4.4 If true, append "1\n" to ss; otherwise, append "0\n" to ss
5. Print the concatenation of all elements in ss
