1. Read two integer inputs, n and m, from the user.
2. Initialize an empty set, c.
3. Repeat the following steps n times:
   1. Read a string input, s, from the user.
   2. Find the index of "S" in s and the index of "G" in s.
   3. Calculate the difference between the index of "S" and the index of "G".
   4. Add the calculated difference to the set c.
4. Check if any element in the set c is less than 0.
5. If any element is less than 0, output -1.
6. Otherwise, output the number of unique elements in the set c.
