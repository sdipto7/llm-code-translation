1. Initialize an empty list t
2. For i from 0 to 3
   1. Read a line of input and convert it into a list of characters l
   2. Append l to t
3. Initialize black, white, and correct to 0
4. For i from 0 to 2
   1. For j from 0 to 2
      1. Check the value of t[i][j] and increment black or white accordingly
      2. Check the value of t[i][j+1] and increment black or white accordingly
      3. Check the value of t[i+1][j] and increment black or white accordingly
      4. Check the value of t[i+1][j+1] and increment black or white accordingly
      5. If (black == 0 or black == 3 or white == 0 or white == 3 or white == 4 or black == 4)
         1. Set correct to 1
         2. Break out of inner loop
      6. Reset black and white to 0
5. If correct == 1
   1. Output 'YES'
Else
   1. Output 'NO'
