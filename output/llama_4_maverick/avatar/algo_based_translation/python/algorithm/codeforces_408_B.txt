1. Import necessary modules and functions.
2. Define a function `solution`.
3. Within `solution`, read a line of input and count the frequency of each character using a counter, storing it as `bought_count`.
4. Read another line of input and count the frequency of each character using a counter, storing it as `made_count`.
5. Initialize a variable `res` to 0.
6. Iterate over each color in `made_count`.
7. For each color, check if it exists in `bought_count`.
8. If a color is not found in `bought_count`, return and print -1.
9. If the color exists, increment `res` by the minimum count between `bought_count` and `made_count` for that color.
10. After iterating over all colors, print the value of `res`.
11. Define a `main` function.
12. Within `main`, set `t` to 1.
13. Iterate `t` times, calling the `solution` function in each iteration.
14. Execute the `main` function.
