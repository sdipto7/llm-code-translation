1. Read two integers n and x from input
2. Read n integers into a list a
3. Sort the list a in ascending order
4. Initialize a variable ans to 0
5. If the smallest element in a is greater than x, then 
   5.1. Output 0
   5.2. Terminate the program
6. For each element i in the sorted list a, 
   6.1. If i is greater than x, then 
      6.1.1. Set x to 0
      6.1.2. Exit the loop
   6.2. Subtract i from x
   6.3. Increment ans by 1
7. If x is not equal to 0, then decrement ans by 1
8. Output the value of ans
