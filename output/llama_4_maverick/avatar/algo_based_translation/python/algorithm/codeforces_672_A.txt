1. Initialize an empty list li and a variable ind to 0.
2. For i ranging from 1 to 370:
   1. Initialize an empty list temp and variables p, q to i.
   2. Initialize a variable count to 0.
   3. While p is not equal to 0:
      1. Perform integer division of p by 10 and store the result back in p.
      2. Increment count by 1.
   4. If count equals 1:
      1. Append i to li.
   5. If count equals 2 or count equals 3:
      1. Clear temp.
      2. While q is not equal to 0:
         1. Calculate the remainder of q divided by 10 and store it in x.
         2. Perform integer division of q by 10 and store the result back in q.
         3. Append x to temp.
      3. Concatenate the reverse of temp to li.
3. Remove the last two elements from li.
4. Read an integer n from input.
5. Print the (n-1)th element of li.
