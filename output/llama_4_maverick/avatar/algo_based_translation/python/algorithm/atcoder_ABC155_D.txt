1. Read N and K from input
2. Read array A of size N from input
3. Sort array A in ascending order
4. Initialize ll to -10^18 - 1 and rr to 10^18 + 1
5. While ll + 1 is less than rr:
   6. Calculate x as the average of ll and rr
   7. Initialize tot to 0
   8. For each element A[i] in array A:
      9. If A[i] is negative:
         10. Initialize l to -1 and r to N
         11. While l + 1 is less than r:
            12. Calculate c as the average of l and r
            13. If A[i] * A[c] is less than x:
               14. Update r to c
            15. Else:
               16. Update l to c
         17. Increment tot by N - r
      18. Else:
         19. Initialize l to -1 and r to N
         20. While l + 1 is less than r:
            21. Calculate c as the average of l and r
            22. If A[i] * A[c] is less than x:
               23. Update l to c
            24. Else:
               25. Update r to c
         26. Increment tot by r
      27. If A[i] * A[i] is less than x:
         28. Decrement tot by 1
   29. Update tot to tot divided by 2
   30. If tot is less than K:
      31. Update ll to x
   32. Else:
      33. Update rr to x
34. Output ll
