1. Read two integers l and r from input
2. Initialize curr to r
3. Initialize s to 0
4. While curr is not zero
   4.1. Increment s by 1
   4.2. Update curr to be the integer division of curr by 10
5. Calculate first as 10 raised to the power of s
6. Calculate second as the integer division of first by 2
7. Initialize ans to -1
8. For each value i in the list [l, r, first, second]
   8.1. If i is within the range [l, r]
      8.1.1. Set curr to i
      8.1.2. Initialize rev as an empty string
      8.1.3. For each character k in the string representation of curr
         8.1.3.1. Append the string representation of (9 - integer value of k) to rev
      8.1.4. Update ans to be the maximum of ans and the product of curr and the integer value of rev
9. Output ans
