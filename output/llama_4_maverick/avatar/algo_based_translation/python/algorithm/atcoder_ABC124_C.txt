1. READ input string s
2. CONVERT s to a list of characters
3. CREATE evenCounter = COUNT characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) in s
4. CREATE oddCounter = COUNT characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) in s
5. CALCULATE count1 = length of s - (count of "0" in evenCounter + count of "1" in oddCounter)
6. CALCULATE count2 = length of s - (count of "1" in evenCounter + count of "0" in oddCounter)
7. PRINT minimum of count1 and count2
