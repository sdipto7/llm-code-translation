1. Define function G(a, b)
   1.1 While a mod b is not equal to 0
      1.1.1 Update a to be b and b to be a mod b
   1.2 Return b

2. Define function L(a, b)
   2.1 Return (a * b) divided by G(a, b) using integer division

3. Read input and split it into a list l using space as the delimiter
4. Parse the list l into integers x, y, a, b

5. Calculate lcm = L(x, y)

6. Print (b divided by lcm using integer division) - ((a - 1) divided by lcm using integer division)
