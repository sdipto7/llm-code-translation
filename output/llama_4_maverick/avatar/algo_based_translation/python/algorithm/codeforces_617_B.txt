1. Read input from user and discard it
2. Read a string input from user and store it in 'a'
3. Remove leading and trailing whitespace and '0' from 'a'
4. Split 'a' into substrings separated by '1'
5. For each substring, count the number of '0' in it and add 1 to the count
6. If 'a' contains no '1', then result = 0
7. Otherwise, result = product of the counts obtained in step 5
8. Print the result
