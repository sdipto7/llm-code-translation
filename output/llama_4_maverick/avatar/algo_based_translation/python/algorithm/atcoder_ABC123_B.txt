1. Initialize an empty list called "menu".
2. Repeat the following steps 5 times:
   1. Read a string input "m" from the user.
   2. Extract the last character of "m" and convert it to an integer "e".
   3. If "e" equals 0, then set "e" to 10.
   4. Convert the entire string "m" to an integer and store it along with "e" as a pair in the "menu" list.
3. Sort the "menu" list based on the second element of each pair in ascending order.
4. Initialize a variable "ans" to 0.
5. Iterate through the "menu" list starting from the second element to the end:
   1. For each element, calculate the ceiling of the first element divided by 10, then multiply by 10.
   2. Add the result to "ans".
6. Add the first element of the first pair in the "menu" list to "ans".
7. Output the value of "ans".
