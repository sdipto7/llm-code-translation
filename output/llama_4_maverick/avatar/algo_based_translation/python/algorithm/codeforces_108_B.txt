1. Read input from user and discard it
2. Read a list of numbers from user and store it in a list 'a'
3. Convert all elements in 'a' to integers
4. Sort 'a' in ascending order
5. Iterate through 'a' starting from the second element (index 1)
6. For each element, check if it is not equal to the previous element and less than twice the previous element
7. If the condition in step 6 is met, return 'YES'
8. If the loop completes without finding a match, return 'NO'
