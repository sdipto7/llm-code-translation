1. Read four integers: x, y, a, b
2. Initialize an empty list: games
3. Iterate from a to x (inclusive)
   3.1. For each iteration value i, check if i is less than or equal to b
   3.2. If i is less than or equal to b, skip to the next iteration
   3.3. If i is greater than b, iterate from b to y (inclusive)
      3.3.1. For each iteration value j, check if i is greater than j
      3.3.2. If i is greater than j, add the pair (i, j) to the games list
4. Print the size of the games list
5. Iterate over the games list
   5.1. For each pair in the games list, print the pair in the format "first_value second_value"
