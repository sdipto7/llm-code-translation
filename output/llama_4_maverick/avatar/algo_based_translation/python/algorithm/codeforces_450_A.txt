1. Read two integers n and m from input
2. Read a list of n integers into list l
3. Initialize an empty list l2
4. For each element i in list l
   4.1 If i is divisible by m
      4.1.1 Append i divided by m to l2
   4.2 Else
      4.2.1 Append i divided by m plus 1 to l2
5. Find the maximum value mx in list l2
6. For each index i in the range from 0 to n-1
   6.1 If the element at index i in l2 equals mx
      6.1.1 Store i as ind
7. Print ind plus 1
