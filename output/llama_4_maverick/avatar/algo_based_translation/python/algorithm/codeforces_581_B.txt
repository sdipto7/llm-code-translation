1. Read integer n from input
2. Read n integers from input and store them in array arr
3. Initialize array ans of size n with all elements as 0
4. Initialize variable mx with the last element of arr
5. Iterate from n-2 to 0 with step -1
   5.1. Calculate ans[i] as maximum of 0 and (mx - arr[i] + 1)
   5.2. If arr[i] is greater than mx, update mx with arr[i]
6. Print all elements of ans
