1. Read n and k from input
2. Initialize x to 0
3. If k is less than or equal to maximum of (n squared divided by 2) and (n squared minus (n squared divided by 2))
4. Then 
    4.1 Print 'YES'
    4.2 For i from 0 to n-1
        4.2.1 For j from 0 to n-1
            4.2.1.1 If (i modulus 2 equals j modulus 2) and x is less than k
                4.2.1.1.1 Print 'L'
                4.2.1.1.2 Increment x by 1
            4.2.1.2 Else
                4.2.1.2.1 Print 'S'
        4.2.2 Print new line
5. Else 
    5.1 Print 'NO'
