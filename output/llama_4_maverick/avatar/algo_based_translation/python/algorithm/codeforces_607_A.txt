1. Initialize n as an integer input from the user.
2. Create two lists, l and dp, each of size 1000010, with all elements initialized to 0.
3. For i ranging from 0 to n-1:
   3.1. Input two integers, a and b.
   3.2. Set l[a] to b.
4. If l[0] is greater than 0, set dp[0] to 1.
5. Initialize mx to 0.
6. For i ranging from 1 to 1000009:
   6.1. If l[i] equals 0, set dp[i] to dp[i-1].
   6.2. Else:
      6.2.1. If l[i] is greater than or equal to i, set dp[i] to 1.
      6.2.2. Else, set dp[i] to dp[i-l[i]-1] + 1.
   6.3. If dp[i] is greater than mx, set mx to dp[i].
7. Output n - mx.
