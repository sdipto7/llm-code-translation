1. READ input string s
2. INITIALIZE result as an empty string
3. INITIALIZE i as 0
4. WHILE i is less than the length of s
   4.1 IF the character at index i in s is "."
      4.1.1 APPEND '0' to result
   4.2 ELSE
      4.2.1 INCREMENT i by 1
      4.2.2 IF the character at index i in s is "."
         4.2.2.1 APPEND '1' to result
      4.2.3 ELSE
         4.2.3.1 APPEND '2' to result
   4.3 INCREMENT i by 1
5. PRINT result
