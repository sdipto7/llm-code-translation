1. Read the number of elements n from the input.
2. Read n integers from the input and store them in a list a.
3. Initialize a variable pre to positive infinity.
4. Initialize a variable ans to 0.
5. Sort the list a in descending order.
6. Iterate over the sorted list a using a loop counter j from 0 to n-1.
7. In each iteration, update ans by adding the maximum of 0 and the minimum of pre-1 and the current element a[j].
8. Update pre to be the maximum of 0 and the minimum of pre-1 and the current element a[j].
9. After the loop completes, output the value of ans.
