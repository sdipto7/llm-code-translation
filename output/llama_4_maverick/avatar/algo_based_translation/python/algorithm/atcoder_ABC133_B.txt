1. Read n and d from input
2. Initialize points as an empty list
3. For i from 1 to n:
   1. Read a point from input
   2. Append the point to points
4. Define function dist(x, y):
   1. Initialize tmp to 0.0
   2. For i from 0 to d-1:
      1. tmp = tmp + (x[i] - y[i])^2
   3. Return square root of tmp
5. Initialize count to 0
6. For i from 0 to n-1:
   1. For j from i+1 to n-1:
      1. If dist(points[i], points[j]) is an integer:
         1. count = count + 1
7. Print count
