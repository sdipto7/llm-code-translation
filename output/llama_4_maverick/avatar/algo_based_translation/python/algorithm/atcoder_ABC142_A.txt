1. Import necessary mathematical functions
2. Define function next_int
   2.1 Return integer value from user input
3. Define function next_ints
   3.1 Return list of integers from user input separated by spaces
4. Set n to the result of next_int
5. Initialize t to 0
6. Loop from 0 to n-1
   6.1 If (current loop index + 1) is odd
      6.1.1 Increment t by 1
7. Print the result of t divided by n
