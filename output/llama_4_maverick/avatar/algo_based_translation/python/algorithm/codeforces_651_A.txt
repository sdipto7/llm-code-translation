1. Read two integers from input, separated by a space, and store them in x and y.
2. Calculate the maximum value between the expression (x + y - 3 + ((y - x) modulo 3 greater than 0)) and 0.
3. Print the calculated maximum value.
4. Define a function num_inp that reads an integer from input.
5. Define a function arr_inp that reads a list of integers from input, separated by spaces.
6. Define a function sp_inp that reads two or more integers from input, separated by spaces, and returns them as a map object.
7. Define a function str_inp that reads a string from input.
