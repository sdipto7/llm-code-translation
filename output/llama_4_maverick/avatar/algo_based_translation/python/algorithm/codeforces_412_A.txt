1. Read two integers n and k from input
2. Read a string v from input
3. Initialize array d with two string values "LEFT" and "RIGHT"
4. Determine boolean value f based on condition k - 1 < n - k
5. Calculate integer value m as minimum of k - 1 and n - k
6. Initialize empty array a
7. Iterate from 0 to m - 1 and append d[not f] to array a in each iteration
8. Iterate over characters in string v in reverse order if f is true, otherwise in normal order
9. For each character i in the iteration, append "PRINT " + i to array a
10. Append d[f] to array a after appending "PRINT " + i
11. Print elements of array a (excluding the last element) separated by newline characters
