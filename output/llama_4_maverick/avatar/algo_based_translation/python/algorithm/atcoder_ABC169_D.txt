1. Set MOD = 10^9 + 7 and INF = 999999999999999999999999
2. Read integer n from input
3. If n equals 1 then
   1. Output 0
   2. Exit
4. Function prime_factorize(n)
   1. Initialize empty list a
   2. While n is divisible by 2
      1. Append 2 to a
      2. n = n / 2
   3. Initialize f = 3
   4. While f * f is less than or equal to n
      1. If n is divisible by f then
         1. Append f to a
         2. n = n / f
      2. Else
         1. f = f + 2
   5. If n is not equal to 1 then
      1. Append n to a
   6. Return a
5. fac_ = prime_factorize(n)
6. fac = Counter(fac_)
7. Initialize ans = 0
8. For each prime factor p and its exponent e in fac
   1. x = e
   2. i = 1
   3. While x is greater than or equal to i
      1. x = x - i
      2. ans = ans + 1
      3. i = i + 1
9. Output ans
