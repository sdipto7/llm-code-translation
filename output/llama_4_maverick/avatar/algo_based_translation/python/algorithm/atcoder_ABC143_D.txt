1. Read input values into n and list l
2. Sort list l in ascending order
3. Initialize variable ans to 0
4. For i from 0 to n-1
   4.1 For j from i+1 to n-1
      4.1.1 Calculate a = l[i] and b = l[j]
      4.1.2 Find right = index of first element in l greater than or equal to a + b
      4.1.3 Find left = index of last element in l less than or equal to max(a - b, b - a)
      4.1.4 Calculate tmp = max(0, right - left)
      4.1.5 If left <= i < right then tmp = tmp - 1
      4.1.6 If left <= j < right then tmp = tmp - 1
      4.1.7 ans = ans + tmp
5. Print ans divided by 3 using integer division
