1. Read integer n from input
2. Initialize empty list m
3. For i from 1 to n:
   1. Read list of integers from input and append to m
4. Sort m in descending order
5. Set a to the first element of m
6. For each element i in m (starting from the second element):
   1. If the second element of i is greater than the second element of a:
      1. Print 'Happy Alex'
      2. Exit loop
   2. Set a to i
7. If loop completes without exiting:
   1. Print 'Poor Alex'
