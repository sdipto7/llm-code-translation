1. Read two integers n and m from input
2. Initialize an empty list l
3. For i from 0 to n-1:
    4. Read a string s from input
    5. Convert s to a list of characters
    6. For j from 0 to m-1:
        7. If the character at index j in s is '.':
            8. If (i + j) is odd:
                9. Replace the character at index j in s with 'W'
            10. Else:
                11. Replace the character at index j in s with 'B'
    12. Append the modified list s to l
13. For each list c in l:
    14. Join the characters in c into a string
    15. Print the resulting string
