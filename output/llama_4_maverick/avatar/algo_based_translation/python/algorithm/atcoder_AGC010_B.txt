   4.2. Append first element of a to the end of a
   4.3. Check if sum of ((k - current element + previous element) modulo n) for all consecutive pairs in a is not zero
   4.4. Or check if count of ((k - current element + previous element) divided by n is non-negative) for all consecutive pairs in a is not equal to n
   4.5. If either condition in 4.3 or 4.4 is true
