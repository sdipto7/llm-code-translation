1. Read integer n from input
2. Initialize two empty lists, low and high
3. For i from 1 to n:
   3.1 Read two integers, a and b, from input
   3.2 Append a to low and b to high
4. Sort low in ascending order
5. Sort high in ascending order
6. If n is odd:
   6.1 median_high = high[(n+1)/2 - 1]
   6.2 median_low = low[(n+1)/2 - 1]
   6.3 result = median_high - median_low + 1
7. Else:
   7.1 median_high = (high[n/2 - 1] + high[n/2]) / 2
   7.2 median_low = (low[n/2 - 1] + low[n/2]) / 2
   7.3 result = (median_high - median_low) * 2 + 1
8. Print result as an integer
