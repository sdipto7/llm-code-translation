2. READ A as a list of N integers
3. INITIALIZE mn to N + 1 and mx to -1
4. FOR i FROM 0 TO N-1
   4.1 IF (i + 1) is not equal to A[i]
      4.1.1 UPDATE mn to minimum of mn and i
      4.1.2 UPDATE mx to maximum of mx and i
5. IF mx is equal to -1
   5.1 PRINT '0 0'
6. ELSE
   6.1 REVERSE the sublist of A from index mn to mx (inclusive)
   6.2 IF the modified list A is sorted in ascending order
      6.2.1 PRINT (mn + 1) and (mx + 1)
   6.3 ELSE
      6.3.1 PRINT '0 0'
