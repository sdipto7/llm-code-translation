1. Read two values v1 and v2 from input, split by space
2. Read two values t and d from input, split by space
3. Convert v1, v2, t, and d to integers
4. Initialize a variable a to 1
5. Initialize a variable v to v1
6. Initialize a variable distance to 0
7. Loop from 0 to t-1
   8. Check if v - v2 is greater than (t - current iteration - 1) * d
   9. If true, then multiply a by -1 and update v to (t - current iteration - 1) * d + v2
   10. Add v to distance
   11. Update v by adding a * d to it
12. Print the final value of distance
