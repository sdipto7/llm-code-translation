1. Initialize a class CodeforcesTask397BSolution
2. Define a method __init__ 
   1. Initialize result as an empty string
   2. Initialize t as 0
   3. Initialize queries as an empty list
3. Define a method read_input
   1. Read the value of t from input and convert it to an integer
   2. Loop t times
      1. Read a line from input, split it into integers, and append it to queries
4. Define a method process_task
   1. Initialize an empty list res
   2. Loop through each query in queries
      1. Calculate k as the integer division of query[0] by query[1]
      2. If k * query[2] is greater than or equal to query[0], append "Yes" to res; otherwise, append "No"
   3. Join the elements of res with newline characters and store it in result
5. Define a method get_result
   1. Return the value of result
6. In the main execution block
   1. Create an instance of CodeforcesTask397BSolution named Solution
   2. Call the read_input method on Solution
   3. Call the process_task method on Solution
   4. Print the result of calling get_result on Solution
