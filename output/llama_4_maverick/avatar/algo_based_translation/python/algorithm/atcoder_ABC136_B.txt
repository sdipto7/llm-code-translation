2. INITIALIZE i TO 1
3. INITIALIZE ans TO 0
4. WHILE 10 RAISED TO THE POWER OF i IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO N
   4.1. INCREMENT ans BY ((10 RAISED TO THE POWER OF i) - (10 RAISED TO THE POWER OF (i-1)))
   4.2. INCREMENT i BY 2
5. INCREMENT ans BY MAX(0, N - (10 RAISED TO THE POWER OF (i-1)) + 1)
6. PRINT ans
