1. Read input into variable u
2. Parse u into two integers n and k
3. Read n integers into array M
4. Initialize variable m to 0
5. Loop from j = 0 to n-1
   5.1 Loop from p = 0 to n-1
      5.1.1 If M[p] equals 0
         5.1.1.1 Print p+1
         5.1.1.2 Break loop p
   5.2 Loop from l = 0 to p-k
      5.2.1 Decrement M[l] by 1
   5.3 Decrement M[p] by 1
