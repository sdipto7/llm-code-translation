1. Read height (h) and width (w) from input
2. Initialize a 2D graph with size h x w
3. For each row in the graph:
   1. Read a string of characters from input
   2. For each character in the string:
      1. If character is '#', set corresponding graph cell to 0
      2. Otherwise, set corresponding graph cell to infinity
4. For each column from left to second last:
   1. Update the value of the next column's cells to be the minimum of its current value and the value of the previous column's cell plus 1
5. For each column from right to second:
   1. Update the value of the previous column's cells to be the minimum of its current value and the value of the next column's cell plus 1
6. For each row from top to second last:
   1. Update the value of the next row's cells to be the minimum of its current value and the value of the previous row's cell plus 1
7. For each row from bottom to second:
   1. Update the value of the previous row's cells to be the minimum of its current value and the value of the next row's cell plus 1
8. Find the maximum value in the graph
9. Output the maximum value as an integer
