1. READ number of elements (inp)
2. READ list of integers (lista) with 'inp' number of elements
3. FOR each index i in lista
   3.1 IF i is the first element
      3.1.1 PRINT difference between next element and current element, and difference between last element and current element
   3.2 ELSE IF i is the last element
      3.2.1 PRINT difference between last element and second last element, and difference between last element and first element
   3.3 ELSE
      3.3.1 IF difference between current element and previous element is greater than difference between next element and current element
         3.3.1.1 SET min difference to difference between next element and current element
      3.3.2 ELSE
         3.3.2.1 SET min difference to difference between current element and previous element
      3.3.3 PRINT min difference
      3.3.4 IF difference between last element and current element is greater than difference between current element and first element
         3.3.4.1 PRINT difference between last element and current element
      3.3.5 ELSE
         3.3.5.1 PRINT difference between current element and first element
