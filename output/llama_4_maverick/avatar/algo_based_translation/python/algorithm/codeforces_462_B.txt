1. Read two integers n and k from input
2. Read a string s from input
3. Initialize an array count of size 26 with all elements as 0
4. For each character c in string s
   4.1. Increment count at index (ord(c) - ord('A')) by 1
5. Sort count in descending order
6. Initialize res to 0
7. For i from 0 to 25
   7.1. If count[i] is greater than or equal to k
      7.1.1. res = res + k * k
      7.1.2. Output res
      7.1.3. Exit
   7.2. k = k - count[i]
   7.3. res = res + count[i] * count[i]
8. Output res
