1. Read the number of inputs 'n' from the user.
2. Initialize a dictionary 's' to store the count of each word, default count is 0.
3. Create a list 'l' to store 'n' number of words input by the user.
4. Initialize a flag 'f' to 'Yes'.
5. Initialize a counter 'i' to -1.
6. Iterate over each word 'v' in the list 'l'.
7. For each word 'v', increment its count in the dictionary 's'.
8. If the count of 'v' in 's' is 2 or more, set 'f' to 'No'.
9. If 'i' is not -1 and the last character of the word at index 'i' in 'l' is not equal to the first character of 'v', set 'f' to 'No'.
10. Increment 'i' by 1.
11. After iterating over all words, print the value of 'f'.
