1. READ input into array arr
2. SET length to arr[0]
3. SET arr to sorted arr[1:4] in ascending order
4. IF length is divisible by arr[0] THEN
   4.1. PRINT length divided by arr[0]
   4.2. EXIT
5. SET ans to 0
6. IF arr[0] equals arr[1] THEN
   6.1. FOR i from 0 to length divided by arr[2] (inclusive)
      6.1.1. SET check to length minus i times arr[2]
      6.1.2. IF check is non-negative and check is divisible by arr[0] THEN
         6.1.2.1. SET k to check divided by arr[0]
         6.1.2.2. SET ans to maximum of ans and k plus i
7. ELSE
   7.1. FOR i from 0 to length divided by arr[2] (inclusive)
      7.1.1. FOR j from 0 to length divided by arr[1] (inclusive)
         7.1.1.1. SET check to length minus i times arr[2] minus j times arr[1]
         7.1.1.2. IF check is non-negative and check is divisible by arr[0] THEN
            7.1.1.2.1. SET k to check divided by arr[0]
            7.1.1.2.2. SET ans to maximum of ans and k plus i plus j
8. PRINT ans
9. EXIT
