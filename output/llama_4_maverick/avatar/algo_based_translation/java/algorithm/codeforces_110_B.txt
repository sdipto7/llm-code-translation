1. Read an integer n from the input.
2. Create a character array c of size n.
3. Initialize a variable p to 97.
4. Iterate from i = 0 to 3.
   4.1. For each i, iterate from j = i to n-1 with a step of 4.
      4.1.1. Assign the character represented by the ASCII value p to c[j].
      4.1.2. Increment p by 1.
5. Iterate from i = 0 to n-1.
   5.1. Print the character c[i].
6. End.
