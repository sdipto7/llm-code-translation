1. Read two strings s1 and s2 from the input.
2. Check if s2 can be formed using characters of s1 by verifying if all characters in s2 are present in s1.
3. If s2 cannot be formed, output -1 and terminate.
4. Create frequency maps m1 and m2 for characters in s1 and s2 respectively.
5. Iterate through each character in s1 and update its frequency in m1.
6. Iterate through each character in s2 and update its frequency in m2.
7. Initialize a variable ans to store the count of common characters.
8. Create a set hs to store unique characters in s2.
9. Iterate through each character c in s2.
10. If c is not in hs, add it to hs and calculate the minimum frequency of c in m1 and m2.
11. Add the minimum frequency to ans.
12. Output the value of ans.
