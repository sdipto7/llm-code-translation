1. Read the number of inputs N.
2. Initialize an empty map to store the input strings.
3. For i from 0 to N-1, read a string and store it in the map with index i.
4. Initialize a flag 'ans' to true.
5. Initialize an empty map 'past' to store the previously encountered strings.
6. Initialize a variable 'next' to an empty string.
7. For i from 0 to N-1, perform the following steps:
   8. Check if the string at index i is already present in 'past'. 
   9. If it is present, set 'ans' to false and exit the loop.
   10. Store the string at index i in 'past'.
   11. If i is not 0, check if the first character of the string at index i matches 'next'.
   12. If it does not match, set 'ans' to false and exit the loop.
   13. Update 'next' with the last character of the string at index i.
14. If 'ans' is true, output "Yes".
15. If 'ans' is false, output "No".
