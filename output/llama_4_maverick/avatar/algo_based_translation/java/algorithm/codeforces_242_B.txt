1. Initialize a variable INF to a large integer value (1e9 + 5).
2. Read an integer n from the input.
3. Create two empty lists a and b to store integers.
4. Initialize two variables, left and right, to INF and 0 respectively.
5. Iterate n times:
   5.1. Read two integers and append them to lists a and b respectively.
   5.2. Update left to be the minimum of left and the last element added to a.
   5.3. Update right to be the maximum of right and the last element added to b.
6. Iterate through the lists a and b:
   6.1. Check if the current element in a is equal to left and the corresponding element in b is equal to right.
   6.2. If the condition is met, output the current index plus one and terminate.
7. If the loop completes without finding a match, output -1.
