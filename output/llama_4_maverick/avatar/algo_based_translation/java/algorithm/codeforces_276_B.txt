1. Read input string from the standard input.
2. Create an empty map to store the frequency of characters in the string.
3. Iterate over each character in the input string.
4. For each character, check if it exists in the map.
5. If the character exists, increment its count by 1.
6. If the character does not exist, add it to the map with a count of 1.
7. Initialize a counter for odd counts to 0.
8. Iterate over the entries in the map.
9. For each entry, check if the count is odd.
10. If the count is odd, increment the odd count counter.
11. Check if the odd count is less than or equal to 1 or if it is odd.
12. If the condition is true, output "First".
13. Otherwise, output "Second".
14. Flush the output buffer to ensure the result is printed.
