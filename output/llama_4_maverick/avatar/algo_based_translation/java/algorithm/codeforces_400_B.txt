1. Read two integers, n and m, from the input.
2. Read n strings into an array.
3. Initialize an array of length n to store the differences between the indices of 'S' and 'G' in each string.
4. Iterate through each string in the array.
5. For each string, find the indices of 'G' and 'S'.
6. If the index of 'G' is greater than the index of 'S', mark a flag as -1.
7. Store the difference between the indices of 'S' and 'G' in the array.
8. Create a set to store unique differences.
9. Add each difference from the array to the set.
10. If the flag is -1, output -1.
11. Otherwise, output the size of the set.
