1. Initialize an array `FfriendPerDay` of size 367 with all elements as 0.
2. Initialize an array `MfriendPerDay` of size 367 with all elements as 0.
3. Initialize a variable `answer` to 0.
4. Read the value of `n`.
5. Iterate `n` times:
   1. Read a character `c`.
   2. Read two integers `a` and `b`.
   3. Iterate from `a` to `b` (inclusive):
      1. If `c` is 'M', increment `MfriendPerDay[j]`.
      2. If `c` is not 'M', increment `FfriendPerDay[j]`.
      3. If `MfriendPerDay[j]` is less than `FfriendPerDay[j]` and `MfriendPerDay[j]` is greater than `answer`, update `answer` to `MfriendPerDay[j]`.
      4. If `MfriendPerDay[j]` is not less than `FfriendPerDay[j]` and `FfriendPerDay[j]` is greater than `answer`, update `answer` to `FfriendPerDay[j]`.
6. Output the value of `answer * 2`.
