1. Read input values N and M from the input.
2. Initialize a priority queue q to store Job objects.
3. For N iterations, read input values a and b, create a Job object with a and b, and add it to q.
4. Initialize a counter cnt to 0.
5. Initialize a priority queue jobQ to store integers in reverse order.
6. Iterate from 1 to M.
7. For each iteration i, while q is not empty, check the Job object at the top of q.
8. If the Job object's a is less than or equal to i, remove the Job object from q, and add its b to jobQ.
9. If jobQ is not empty, remove the top element from jobQ and add it to cnt.
10. Output the value of cnt.
