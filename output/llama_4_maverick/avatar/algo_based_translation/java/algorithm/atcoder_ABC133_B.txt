1. Read two integers N and D from the input.
2. Create a 2D array of size N x D to store vectors.
3. Populate the 2D array by reading N vectors, each of dimension D, from the input.
4. Initialize a variable answer to 0.
5. Iterate over all pairs of vectors (i, j) where 0 <= i < N-1 and i+1 <= j < N.
6. For each pair (i, j), calculate the squared Euclidean distance between the two vectors.
7. Compute the square root of the squared distance.
8. Check if the square root is an integer by verifying if its fractional part is less than 0.001.
9. If the square root is an integer, increment the answer by 1.
10. Output the final value of answer.
