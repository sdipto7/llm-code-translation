1. Read two integers n and m from the input.
2. Create two empty queues, q1 and q2.
3. For i ranging from 1 to n, perform the following steps:
   3.1. Read an integer from the input and add it to q1.
   3.2. Add i to q2.
4. Initialize a variable ans to 0.
5. While q1 is not empty, perform the following steps:
   5.1. Check the front element of q1.
   5.2. If the front element of q1 is less than or equal to m, then:
      5.2.1. Remove the front element from q1.
      5.2.2. Remove the front element from q2 and store it in ans.
   5.3. If the front element of q1 is greater than m, then:
      5.3.1. Remove the front element from q1, subtract m from it, and add the result back to q1.
      5.3.2. Remove the front element from q2, and add it back to q2.
6. Output the value of ans.
