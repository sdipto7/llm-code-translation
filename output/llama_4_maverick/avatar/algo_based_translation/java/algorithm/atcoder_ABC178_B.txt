1. Initialize a FastReader object to read input from the standard input.
2. Create an array of size 4 to store long integers.
3. Read 4 long integers from the input and store them in the array.
4. Calculate the products of the following pairs of numbers from the array: 
   - a[0] and a[2]
   - a[1] and a[3]
   - a[0] and a[3]
   - a[1] and a[2]
5. Compare the calculated products to find the maximum value.
6. Output the maximum product found in step 5.
