1. Read a line of input and split it into an array of strings using space as the delimiter.
2. Read another line of input and tokenize it into integers.
3. Parse the tokenized integers into two separate integer variables.
4. Read a third line of input into a string variable.
5. Compare the string variable with the first element of the array of strings obtained in step 1.
6. If they are equal, calculate and output the value of the first integer variable minus one, followed by the second integer variable.
7. If they are not equal, output the value of the first integer variable, followed by the second integer variable minus one.
