5. If any character is not '4' or '7', mark it as invalid.
6. If the input is invalid, output "NO".
7. If the input is valid, calculate the sum of the first half of the digits in the character array.
8. Calculate the sum of the second half of the digits in the character array.
9. Compare the two sums.
10. If the sums are equal, output "YES".
11. If the sums are not equal, output "NO".
