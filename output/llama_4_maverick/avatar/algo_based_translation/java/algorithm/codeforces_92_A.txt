1. Read two integers n and k from input.
2. Initialize i to 1 and req to 1.
3. While k - req is greater than or equal to 0, perform the following steps:
   3.1. Subtract req from k.
   3.2. Increment i by 1.
   3.3. If i is not divisible by n, set req to the remainder of i divided by n.
   3.4. If i is divisible by n, set req to n.
4. Output the value of k.
