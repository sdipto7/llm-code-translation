1. Read a line of input into a character array.
2. Determine the length of the character array.
3. Initialize an empty set (not used in the given code).
4. Read an integer K.
5. Initialize a result variable to 0.
6. Iterate K times.
7. In each iteration, read a string of length 2.
8. Initialize two counters, a and b, to 0.
9. Iterate through the character array.
10. For each character in the array, check if it matches the first character of the string. If so, increment a.
11. If it matches the second character of the string, increment b.
12. If it matches neither, add the minimum of a and b to the result and reset a and b to 0.
13. After iterating through the character array, add the minimum of a and b to the result.
14. Output the final result.
