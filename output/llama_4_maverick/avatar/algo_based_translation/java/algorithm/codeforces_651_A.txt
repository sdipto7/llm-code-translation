1. Read two integers from the input.
2. Initialize a counter to 0.
3. If both integers are equal to 1, output the counter.
4. Otherwise, enter a loop that continues as long as both integers are greater than or equal to 1.
5. Inside the loop, check which integer is greater than or equal to the other.
6. If the first integer is greater than or equal to the second, increment the second integer and decrement the first integer by 2.
7. If the second integer is greater than the first, increment the first integer and decrement the second integer by 2.
8. Increment the counter.
9. Check if either integer has become less than or equal to 0 after the update.
10. If either integer is less than or equal to 0, exit the loop and output the counter.
11. Close the output stream.
