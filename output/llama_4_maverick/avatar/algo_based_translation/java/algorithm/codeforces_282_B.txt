1. Read the number of inputs, n.
2. Initialize an empty character array of size n.
3. Initialize two variables, s1 and s2, to 0.
4. Initialize a flag variable to 0 and a counter j to 0.
5. Iterate n times:
   1. Read two integers, x and y.
   2. Calculate temp1 = s1 + x and temp2 = s2 + y.
   3. Check if the absolute difference between temp1 and s2 is less than or equal to 500.
      1. If true, update s1 to s1 + x and store 'A' at the jth index of the character array. Increment j.
   4. Else, check if the absolute difference between temp2 and s1 is less than or equal to 500.
      1. If true, update s2 to s2 + y and store 'G' at the jth index of the character array. Increment j.
   5. If both conditions are false, set the flag to 1 and exit the loop.
6. If the flag is 1, output -1.
7. Else, create a string from the character array and output it.
