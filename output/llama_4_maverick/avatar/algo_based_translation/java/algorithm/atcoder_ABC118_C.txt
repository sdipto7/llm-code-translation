1. Read the number of inputs n from the user.
2. If n equals 1, read the next integer and output it, then terminate.
3. Initialize an empty list to store integers.
4. Read n integers from the user and store them in the list.
5. Sort the list in ascending order.
6. If the largest number in the list is 0, output 0 and terminate.
7. Initialize a variable ans to 0.
8. Enter a loop that continues until the list contains only one element.
9. Within the loop, process the list using the following steps:
   1. Remove all elements that are 0 from the list.
   2. Find the smallest non-zero element min in the list.
   3. For each remaining element in the list, replace it with its remainder when divided by min.
   4. If any element becomes 1, output 1 and terminate.
   5. Sort the list in ascending order.
10. Once the list contains only one element, assign this element to ans.
11. Output the value of ans.
