1. Read an integer n from the input.
2. Calculate the square of n.
3. Initialize two empty lists, odd and even.
4. Iterate from 1 to the square of n.
5. For each number in the iteration, check if it is even or odd.
6. If the number is even, add it to the even list.
7. If the number is odd, add it to the odd list.
8. Calculate the loop count by dividing the square of n by n.
9. Calculate the div count by dividing the loop count by 2.
10. Iterate from 1 to the loop count.
11. For each iteration in step 10, iterate div times.
12. For each iteration in step 11, check if the current loop count is odd or even.
13. If the loop count is odd, remove the first element from the odd list and the last element from the even list, and print them.
14. If the loop count is even, remove the first element from the even list and the last element from the odd list, and print them.
15. Print a newline after each iteration in step 10.
16. Close the output stream.
