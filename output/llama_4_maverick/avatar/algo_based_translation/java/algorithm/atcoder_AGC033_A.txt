1. Read the input values H and W.
2. Initialize a 2D array A of size H x W to store the input grid.
3. Initialize a queue to store the cells to be processed.
4. Iterate over each cell in the grid.
5. For each cell, if the cell contains '#', add its coordinates and a depth value 0 to the queue.
6. Initialize a 2D array flag of size H x W to keep track of visited cells.
7. Initialize a variable ans to store the maximum depth.
8. Define the possible directions for movement (dx, dy) as (1, -1, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 1, -1) respectively.
9. Perform a BFS traversal using the queue.
10. For each cell processed, explore its neighboring cells in the four possible directions.
11. For each neighboring cell, check if it is within the grid boundaries and is not visited before and contains '.'.
12. If the neighboring cell satisfies the conditions, mark it as visited, add it to the queue with an incremented depth, and update ans with the new depth.
13. Continue the BFS traversal until the queue is empty.
14. Output the value of ans.
