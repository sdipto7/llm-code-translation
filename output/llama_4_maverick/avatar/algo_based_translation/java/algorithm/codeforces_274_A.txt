1. Read the number of elements `n` and the divisor `k` from the input.
2. Initialize an array of size `n` to store the elements.
3. Read `n` elements from the input and store them in the array.
4. Sort the array in ascending order.
5. Initialize a count variable to 0 and an empty set to store unique elements.
6. Iterate through the sorted array.
7. For each element, check if it is not divisible by `k` or if it is divisible by `k` but its quotient is not in the set.
8. If the condition in step 7 is met, increment the count and add the element to the set.
9. After iterating through the entire array, output the count.
