1. Read input values for n and k.
2. Initialize an array of 26 objects to store the count of each letter from 'A' to 'Z'.
3. Read a string s of length n.
4. Count the occurrences of each letter in the string s and store them in the array.
5. Initialize a variable ans to 0 to store the final result.
6. Iterate k times.
7. Within each iteration, sort the array of objects based on the count of letters in descending order.
8. Determine the minimum between the count of the most frequent letter and the remaining iterations (k - current iteration).
9. Add the square of the minimum value to ans.
10. Subtract the minimum value from the count of the most frequent letter.
11. Increment the iteration counter by the minimum value minus 1.
12. Output the final result stored in ans.
