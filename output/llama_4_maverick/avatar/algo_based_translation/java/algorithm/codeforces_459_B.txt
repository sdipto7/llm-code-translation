1. Read the number of elements N from the input.
2. Read N integers into an array A.
3. Sort the array A in ascending order.
4. Identify the minimum element min and the maximum element max in the sorted array A.
5. Initialize counters mins and maxs to 0.
6. Iterate through the array A, incrementing mins for each occurrence of min and maxs for each occurrence of max.
7. If min equals max, calculate the number of pairs as mins * (mins - 1) / 2.
8. If min does not equal max, calculate the number of pairs as mins * maxs.
9. Output the difference between max and min, and the calculated number of pairs.
10. Terminate the process.
