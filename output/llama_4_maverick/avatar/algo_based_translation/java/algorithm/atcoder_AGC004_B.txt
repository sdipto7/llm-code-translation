1. Read the number of elements N from the input.
2. Read a value x from the input.
3. Read N long integers and store them in a list called srimeList.
4. Create a list called costList to store N arrays, each of size N.
5. For each index i from 0 to N-1, perform the following steps:
   1. Initialize the first element of the ith array in costList with the ith element of srimeList.
   2. For each castNum from 1 to N-1, calculate the value of costList[i][castNum] as the minimum of costList[i][castNum-1] and the (i-castNum+N) modulo N element of srimeList.
6. Create a list called result to store N values.
7. For each index i from 0 to N-1, perform the following steps:
   1. Calculate the sum of the ith elements of all arrays in costList.
   2. Calculate the value i*x + sum and store it in the result list.
8. Find the minimum value in the result list.
9. Output the minimum value found in step 8.
