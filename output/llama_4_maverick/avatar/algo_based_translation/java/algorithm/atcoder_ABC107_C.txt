1. Read input values N and K.
2. Read N integers into array S.
3. If K equals 1, then:
   1. Initialize ans to a large value.
   2. Iterate through array S, updating ans with the minimum absolute value encountered.
   3. Output ans.
4. Else if N - K is not equal to 0, then:
   1. Initialize ans to a large value.
   2. Iterate from i = 0 to N - K.
   3. For each i, determine min as S[i] and max as S[i + K - 1].
   4. If min is less than 0 and max is greater than 0, then calculate temp as the minimum of (2 * absolute(min) + max) and (absolute(min) + 2 * max).
   5. Else, calculate temp as the maximum of absolute(min) and absolute(max).
   6. Update ans with the minimum of ans and temp.
   7. Output ans.
5. Else:
   1. Determine min as S[0] and max as S[N - 1].
   2. If min is less than 0 and max is greater than 0, then output the minimum of (2 * absolute(min) + max) and (absolute(min) + 2 * max).
   3. Else, output the maximum of absolute(min) and absolute(max).
