1. Read two integers N and M from the input.
2. Initialize an ArrayList 'a' of size N with all elements set to 0.
3. For M iterations:
   3.1 Read an integer k.
   3.2 For k iterations:
      3.2.1 Read an integer s, decrement it by 1.
      3.2.2 Update the value at index s in 'a' by performing a bitwise OR operation with (1 << current iteration number).
4. Read M integers and store them in a variable p by performing a bitwise OR operation with (x << current iteration number) for each integer x.
5. Initialize a variable ans to 0.
6. Iterate over all possible values of s from 0 to (2^N - 1).
7. For each s, initialize a variable t to 0.
8. Iterate over all values of i from 0 to N-1.
9. For each i, check if the ith bit of s is set.
10. If the ith bit is set, update t by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the value at index i in 'a'.
11. After iterating over all i, check if t is equal to p.
12. If t equals p, increment ans by 1.
13. Output the value of ans.
