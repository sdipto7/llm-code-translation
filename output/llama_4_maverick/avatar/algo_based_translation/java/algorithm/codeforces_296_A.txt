1. Read the input from the input stream.
2. Create an InputReader object to read the input.
3. Create a PrintWriter object to write the output.
4. Initialize a Task object to solve the problem.
5. Call the solve method of the Task object, passing the InputReader and PrintWriter objects.
6. Read an integer n using the InputReader object.
7. Create an array of size 1001 to store the frequency of numbers.
8. Iterate n times and for each iteration, read an integer index and increment the corresponding frequency in the array.
9. Initialize a variable countMax to -1 to store the maximum frequency.
10. Iterate through the frequency array from index 1 to the end.
11. Update countMax if a higher frequency is found.
12. Check if n is even.
13. If n is even, check if countMax is less than or equal to n/2.
14. If n is odd, check if countMax is less than or equal to n/2 + 1.
15. Print "YES" if the condition in step 13 or step 14 is met, otherwise print "NO".
16. Close the PrintWriter object.
