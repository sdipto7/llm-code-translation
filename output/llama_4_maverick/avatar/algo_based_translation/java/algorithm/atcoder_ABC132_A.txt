1. Read input string from the user.
2. Convert the input string into a character array.
3. Create an empty hash map to store characters and their frequencies.
4. Iterate through the character array.
5. For each character, check if it exists in the hash map.
6. If the character exists, increment its frequency by 1.
7. If the character does not exist, add it to the hash map with a frequency of 1.
8. Initialize a flag to indicate whether the string meets the required condition.
9. Iterate through the entries in the hash map.
10. For each entry, check if the frequency is equal to 2.
11. If any frequency is not equal to 2, set the flag to false and exit the loop.
12. Check if the flag is true and the size of the hash map is equal to 2.
13. If both conditions are met, output "Yes".
14. Otherwise, output "No".
15. Close the input stream.
