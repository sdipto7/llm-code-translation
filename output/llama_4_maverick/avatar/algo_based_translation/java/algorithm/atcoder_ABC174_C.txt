1. Read an integer K from the input.
2. Check if K is divisible by 2 or 5. If true, return -1.
3. Check if K is divisible by 7. If true, divide K by 7.
4. Multiply K by 9.
5. Initialize a variable ans to 1.
6. Calculate the remainder of 10 divided by K.
7. If the remainder is not equal to 1, increment ans by 1 and update the remainder by multiplying it by 10 and taking the modulus with K.
8. Repeat step 7 until the remainder equals 1.
9. Return the value of ans.
