1. Read three integers A, B, and n from the input.
2. Check if A is equal to 0.
3. If A is 0, then check if B is 0.
4. If B is 0, output 1.
5. If B is not 0, output "No solution".
6. If A is not 0, check if B is divisible by A.
7. If B is not divisible by A, output "No solution".
8. Divide B by A and store the result in B.
9. Check if B is negative.
10. If B is negative and n is even, output "No solution".
11. If B is negative, make B positive.
12. Iterate over all integers x from 0 to B.
13. For each x, check if x raised to the power of n equals B.
14. If a match is found, output x if B was originally positive, or -x if B was originally negative.
15. If no match is found after iterating over all x, output "No solution".
