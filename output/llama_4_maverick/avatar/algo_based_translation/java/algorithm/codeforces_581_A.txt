1. Read two integers, a and b, from the input.
2. Initialize a counter, count, to 0.
3. Enter a loop that continues until either a or b is not greater than 0.
4. Inside the loop, increment count by 1 and decrement both a and b by 1.
5. Exit the loop when either a or b is not greater than 0.
6. Calculate ans as the sum of the integer division of a by 2 and the integer division of b by 2.
7. Output count and ans.
