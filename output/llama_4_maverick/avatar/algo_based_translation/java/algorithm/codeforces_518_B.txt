1. Read two strings from the input.
2. Create a frequency map of characters in the second string.
3. Iterate through each character in the first string.
4. For each character, check if it exists in the frequency map.
5. If it exists, decrement its count in the map, mark the character as processed, and increment the count of exact matches.
6. Iterate through the processed first string again.
7. For each processed character (marked earlier), check if its case-reversed character exists in the frequency map.
8. If it exists, decrement its count in the map and increment the count of case-reversed matches.
9. Output the counts of exact matches and case-reversed matches.
