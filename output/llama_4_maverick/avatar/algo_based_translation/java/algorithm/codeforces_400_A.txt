1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read a string of 12 characters.
3. Check if the string is a solution for the following column counts: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.
4. For each column count, verify if all characters at positions that are equivalent modulo the column count are 'X'.
5. For each column count that results in a valid solution, append the corresponding grid configuration to a list of solutions.
6. Count the total number of valid solutions found.
7. Output the count of valid solutions.
8. Output the list of grid configurations that are valid solutions.
9. Repeat steps 3-8 for each test case.
