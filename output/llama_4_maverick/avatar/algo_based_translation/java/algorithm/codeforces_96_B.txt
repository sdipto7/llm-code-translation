1. Initialize a Scanner object to read from the standard input.
2. Read a long integer number from the input.
3. Initialize a variable ans to -1 and a variable value to 0.
4. Initialize a variable mask to 2.
5. Enter a while loop that continues as long as value is less than number.
6. Within the loop, convert the current value of mask to a binary string, remove the first character, and store it in s.
7. Increment mask by 1.
8. Count the number of zeros in s.
9. Check if the count of zeros is equal to the count of ones in s; if not, skip to the next iteration.
10. Replace all occurrences of '0' with '4' in s.
11. Replace all occurrences of '1' with '7' in s.
12. Parse the modified string s into a long integer and store it in value.
13. Once the loop exits, output the value of value.
