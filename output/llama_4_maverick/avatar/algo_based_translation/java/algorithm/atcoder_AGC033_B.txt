1. Read input values: height (h), width (w), number of operations (n), initial row (sr), initial column (sc), string s, and string t.
2. Initialize a flag 'end' to False.
3. Initialize variables to track safe rows: usafe to 1 and dsafe to h.
4. Iterate from n-1 to 0 over the characters in string s in reverse order.
5. For each character in s, if it's 'U', increment usafe. If it's 'D', decrement dsafe.
6. Check if usafe > dsafe. If true, set 'end' to True and break the loop.
7. If the current index is greater than 0, check the character at the previous index in string t.
8. If the character in t is 'U', increment dsafe by 1 and cap it at h. If it's 'D', decrement usafe by 1 and ensure it doesn't go below 1.
9. Initialize variables to track safe columns: lsafe to 1 and rsafe to w.
10. Iterate from n-1 to 0 over the characters in string s in reverse order.
11. For each character in s, if it's 'L', increment lsafe. If it's 'R', decrement rsafe.
12. Check if lsafe > rsafe. If true, set 'end' to True and break the loop.
13. If the current index is greater than 0, check the character at the previous index in string t.
14. If the character in t is 'L', increment rsafe by 1 and cap it at w. If it's 'R', decrement lsafe by 1 and ensure it doesn't go below 1.
15. Check if sr is within the range [usafe, dsafe] and sc is within the range [lsafe, rsafe] and 'end' is False.
16. If the conditions in step 15 are met, output "YES". Otherwise, output "NO".
