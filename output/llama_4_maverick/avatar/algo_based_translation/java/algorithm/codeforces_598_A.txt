1. Read the number of test cases q.
2. While q is greater than 0, decrement q by 1.
3. Read the input number n.
4. Calculate x as the integer value of log(n) base 2, then increment x by 1.
5. Calculate the sum s using the formula: s = -2^x + 2 + (n*(n+1))/2 - 2^x.
6. Print the calculated sum s.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until q becomes 0.
