1. Read input from the user and store it in a variable.
2. Convert the input to an integer.
3. If the integer is even and not equal to 2, increment it by 1.
4. Enter a loop that continues indefinitely.
5. Inside the loop, calculate the square root of the current integer.
6. Initialize a counter variable to 3.
7. Iterate from the counter variable up to the square root of the integer, incrementing the counter by 2 in each iteration.
8. Inside the iteration, check if the current integer is divisible by the counter variable.
9. If the integer is divisible, break out of the iteration.
10. If the iteration completes without finding a divisor, break out of the loop.
11. If a divisor is found, increment the integer by 2.
12. Once the loop is exited, output the final integer value.
