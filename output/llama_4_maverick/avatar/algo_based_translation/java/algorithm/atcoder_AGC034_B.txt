1. Read input string from the input stream.
2. Replace all occurrences of "BC" in the input string with "D".
3. Initialize a counter variable `cnt` to 0.
4. Initialize a temporary variable `tmp` to 0.
5. Iterate through each character in the modified string.
6. If the character is 'A', increment `tmp` by 1.
7. If the character is 'D', add the current value of `tmp` to `cnt`.
8. If the character is neither 'A' nor 'D', reset `tmp` to 0.
9. Output the final value of `cnt`.
