1. Read input from the user and store it in a string.
2. Split the input string into two parts using space as the delimiter.
3. Convert the first part into an integer and store it in a variable 'h'.
4. Convert the second part into an integer and store it in a variable 'a'.
5. Initialize a counter variable 'num' to 0.
6. Start a loop that continues until 'h' is less than or equal to 0.
7. In each iteration of the loop, subtract 'a' from 'h'.
8. Increment 'num' by 1 in each iteration.
9. Once the loop ends, output the value of 'num'.
