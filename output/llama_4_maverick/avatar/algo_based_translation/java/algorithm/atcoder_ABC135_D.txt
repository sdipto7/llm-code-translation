1. Read input string from the user.
2. Convert the input string into a character array.
3. Initialize a 2D array dp with dimensions equal to the length of the character array and 13.
4. Initialize a variable base to 1.
5. Iterate over the character array from right to left.
6. For each character, check if it is '?'.
7. If the character is '?', iterate over all possible digits (0-9) and update dp accordingly.
8. If the character is not '?', update dp based on the digit represented by the character.
9. Update the base variable by multiplying it with 10 and taking the modulus with 13.
10. After iterating over the entire character array, return the value stored in dp at the last index and the 5th index (0-indexed).
11. Ensure all updates to dp are done modulo 1e9 + 7.
