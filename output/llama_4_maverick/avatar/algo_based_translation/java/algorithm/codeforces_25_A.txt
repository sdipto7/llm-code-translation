1. Read the input value for n.
2. Create an array of size n+1.
3. Iterate from 1 to n and store the input values in the array.
4. Initialize counters for odd and even numbers to 0.
5. Initialize indices for the last seen odd and even numbers to 0.
6. Iterate through the array from 1 to n.
7. For each number, check if it is even or odd.
8. If the number is even, increment the even counter and update the even index.
9. If the number is odd, increment the odd counter and update the odd index.
10. Compare the counts of odd and even numbers.
11. If the count of odd numbers is greater than the count of even numbers, output the even index.
12. Otherwise, output the odd index.
