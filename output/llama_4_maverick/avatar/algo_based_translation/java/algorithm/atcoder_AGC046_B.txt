1. Initialize a 2D array dp with dimensions 3001 x 3001.
2. Set dp[A][B] to 1.
3. Iterate over the range from A to C (inclusive) for variable c.
4. For each c, iterate over the range from B to D (inclusive) for variable d.
5. If c equals A and d equals B, skip the current iteration.
6. Initialize a variable ans to 0.
7. If c is greater than A, calculate ans as the product of dp[c-1][d] and d, and add it to ans.
8. If d is greater than B, calculate the product of dp[c][d-1] and c, and add it to ans.
9. If both c is greater than A and d is greater than B, subtract the product of dp[c-1][d-1], (c-1), and (d-1) from ans.
10. Update dp[c][d] with the value of ans modulo MOD, ensuring it is non-negative by adding MOD if necessary.
11. Output the value of dp[C][D].
