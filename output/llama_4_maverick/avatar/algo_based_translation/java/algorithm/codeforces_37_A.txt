1. Initialize a FastScanner object to read input from the standard input.
2. Read an integer 'n' using the FastScanner object.
3. Create a HashMap to store the frequency of each integer value.
4. Iterate 'n' times:
   4.1 Read an integer 'val' using the FastScanner object.
   4.2 Check if 'val' exists in the HashMap.
   4.3 If 'val' exists, increment its frequency by 1.
   4.4 If 'val' does not exist, add it to the HashMap with a frequency of 1.
5. Initialize a variable 'max' to store the maximum frequency.
6. Iterate through the entries in the HashMap:
   6.1 For each entry, compare its value (frequency) with 'max'.
   6.2 Update 'max' if the frequency is greater than the current 'max'.
7. Print 'max' followed by the size of the HashMap.
