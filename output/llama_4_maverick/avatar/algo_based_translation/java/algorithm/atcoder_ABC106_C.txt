1. Read input string from the user.
2. Convert the input string into a character array.
3. Read a long integer value representing 'k'.
4. Determine the length of the input string.
5. Iterate from index 0 to 'k-1' over the character array.
6. For each index 'i', check if the character at that index is '1'.
7. If the character is '1' and 'i' equals 'k-1', output 1 and terminate.
8. If the character is not '1', output the character and terminate.
9. If the loop completes without termination, no output is specified in the algorithm.
