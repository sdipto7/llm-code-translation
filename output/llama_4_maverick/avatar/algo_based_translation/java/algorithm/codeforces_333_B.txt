1. Initialize input reader and output writer.
2. Read two integers, n and m, representing the size of a grid and the number of operations.
3. Create two sets, bannedRows and bannedCols, to store the indices of rows and columns that are restricted.
4. Iterate m times, reading two integers, r and c, in each iteration.
5. Check if r is within the range (1, n) and add it to bannedRows if true.
6. Check if c is within the range (1, n) and add it to bannedCols if true.
7. Calculate an initial answer as (n - 2) * 2.
8. Subtract the size of bannedRows from the answer.
9. Subtract the size of bannedCols from the answer.
10. Check if n is odd.
11. If n is odd, calculate the middle index, mid.
12. Check if mid is not present in both bannedRows and bannedCols.
13. If mid is not banned, decrement the answer by 1.
14. Output the final answer.
15. Close the output writer.
