1. Read an integer n from the input.
2. Initialize an empty string s.
3. While n is greater than 0, perform the following steps:
   3.1 Calculate the remainder of n divided by 2 and store it in x.
   3.2 Update n by performing integer division of n by 2.
   3.3 Append the value of x to the string s.
4. Initialize a variable ans to 0.
5. Iterate over each character in the string s.
6. For each character, check if it is equal to '1'.
7. If the character is '1', increment ans by 1.
8. Output the value of ans.
