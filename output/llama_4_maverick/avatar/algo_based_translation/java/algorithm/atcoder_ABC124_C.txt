1. Read input string from the input stream.
2. Create two copies of the input string as string builders a and b.
3. Initialize counters a1 and a2 to 0.
4. Iterate through the string a from the second character to the end.
5. For each character in a, check if it is the same as the previous character.
6. If the characters are the same, flip the current character in a.
7. Increment counter a1 for each flip in a.
8. Iterate through the string b from the second last character to the first.
9. For each character in b, check if it is the same as the next character.
10. If the characters are the same, flip the previous character in b.
11. Increment counter a2 for each flip in b.
12. Output the minimum of counters a1 and a2.
