1. Read three lines of input and store them as word1, word2, and word3.
2. Remove non-alphabetic characters from word1, word2, and word3, and convert them to lowercase.
3. Generate six permutations of word1, word2, and word3 by concatenating them in different orders, resulting in perm1, perm2, perm3, perm4, perm5, and perm6.
4. Read the number of test cases.
5. For each test case, read a line of input and remove non-alphabetic characters, converting it to lowercase.
6. Check if the processed test case matches any of the six permutations (perm1, perm2, perm3, perm4, perm5, perm6).
7. If the test case matches any permutation, output "ACC".
8. If the test case does not match any permutation, output "WA".
9. Repeat steps 5-8 for the specified number of test cases.
