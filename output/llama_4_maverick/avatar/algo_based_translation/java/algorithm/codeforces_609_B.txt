1. Read two integers n and m from input.
2. Initialize an array arr of size n.
3. Initialize an array gen of size 11 with all elements as 0.
4. For i ranging from 0 to n-1, read an integer into arr[i] and increment gen[arr[i]] by 1.
5. Initialize a variable ans to 0.
6. For i ranging from 1 to m, iterate through the following steps:
   6.1 For k ranging from 1 to m, iterate through the following steps:
      6.1.1 If i is not equal to k, increment ans by the product of gen[i] and gen[k].
7. Print the integer division of ans by 2.
