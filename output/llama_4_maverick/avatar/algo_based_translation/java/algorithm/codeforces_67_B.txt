1. Initialize input and output streams.
2. Read two integers n and k from the input.
3. Read n integers into an array bb.
4. Initialize an empty array aa of size n.
5. Initialize a counter m to 0.
6. Iterate from n-1 down to 0.
7. For each iteration in step 6, decrement the value at the corresponding index in bb until it reaches 0.
8. To decrement the value in bb, iterate through the array aa from the start until we find a suitable position.
9. In each iteration of step 8, check if the value at the current index in aa is greater than or equal to the current index in bb plus k.
10. If the condition in step 9 is met, decrement the value in bb.
11. Once the value in bb is decremented to 0, shift the elements in aa to the right to make space for the current index.
12. Insert the current index into the appropriate position in aa.
13. Increment the counter m.
14. After the iteration in step 6 is complete, iterate through the array aa.
15. For each element in aa, add 1 to it and output the result.
16. Output a newline character after all elements are processed.
