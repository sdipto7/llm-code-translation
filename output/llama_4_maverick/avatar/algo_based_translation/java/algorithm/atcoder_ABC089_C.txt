1. Read the number of input strings.
2. Initialize a count array of size 5 with all elements set to 0.
3. Iterate over the range of the input number.
4. For each iteration, read a string.
5. Check the first character of the string.
6. If the first character is 'M', increment the count at index 0.
7. If the first character is 'A', increment the count at index 1.
8. If the first character is 'R', increment the count at index 2.
9. If the first character is 'C', increment the count at index 3.
10. If the first character is 'H', increment the count at index 4.
11. Calculate the result by summing the products of all possible combinations of three counts from the count array.
12. Output the calculated result.
