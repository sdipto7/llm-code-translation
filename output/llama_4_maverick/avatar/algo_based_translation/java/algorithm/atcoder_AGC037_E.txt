1. Read input: N, K, and a string S of length N.
2. Initialize a flag firstTime to true and a variable step to 1.
3. While K is greater than 0:
   1. Create a reversed copy of S, denoted as T.
   2. Create a new string revU by concatenating S and T, then reversing the result.
   3. Initialize sDash to S.
   4. Iterate from N to 0 with a decrement of step:
      1. Extract a substring tmp of length N from revU starting at the current index.
      2. If sDash is lexicographically greater than tmp, update sDash to tmp.
      3. Else, if it's not the first time, break the loop.
   5. If it's the first time:
      1. Set firstTime to false.
      2. If 2 raised to the power of K is greater than N:
         1. Output the first character of sDash repeated N times.
         2. Exit.
   6. Else, double the value of step.
   7. Decrement K.
   8. Update S to sDash, then reverse S.
4. Output the reverse of S.
