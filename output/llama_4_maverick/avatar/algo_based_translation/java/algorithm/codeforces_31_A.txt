1. Read the input value n from the user.
2. Initialize a variable f to 0.
3. Create an array a of size n.
4. Iterate from i = 0 to n-1 and read the input values into the array a.
5. Iterate from k = 0 to n-1.
6. For each k, store the value of a[k] in a variable t.
7. Iterate from i = 0 to n-1.
8. For each i, iterate from j = 0 to n-2.
9. Check if i is not equal to j and if t is equal to the sum of a[i] and a[j].
10. If the condition is met, set f to 1 and break the inner loop.
11. If f is 1, break the middle loop.
12. If f is 1, break the outer loop.
13. If f is 1, print the values k+1, j+1, and i+1.
14. If f is not 1, print -1.
