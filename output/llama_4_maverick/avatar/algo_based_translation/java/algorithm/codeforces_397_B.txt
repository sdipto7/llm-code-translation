1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the values of n, a, and b.
3. Check if n is less than a. If true, output "No" and proceed to the next test case.
4. Check if a equals b. If true, check if n is divisible by a. If true, output "Yes"; otherwise, output "No". Proceed to the next test case.
5. Calculate x as b divided by the difference between b and a.
6. Check if n is greater than x times a. If true, output "Yes" and proceed to the next test case.
7. Initialize low to 1 and high to x + 1. Initialize ans to 1.
8. Perform a binary search:
   - Calculate mid as the average of low and high.
   - If mid times a is less than n, update low to mid + 1.
   - Otherwise, update ans to mid and update high to mid - 1.
   - Repeat until low is greater than high.
9. Check if n is greater than (ans - 1) times b and less than ans times a. If true, output "No"; otherwise, output "Yes".
10. Proceed to the next test case.
11. Repeat steps 2-10 until all test cases are processed.
12. End the program.
