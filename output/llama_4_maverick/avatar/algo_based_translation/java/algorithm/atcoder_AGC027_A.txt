1. Read the number of elements N and the initial value x from the input.
2. Read N integers and store them in a list.
3. Sort the list in ascending order.
4. Initialize a counter num to 0.
5. Iterate through the sorted list from the smallest element to the largest.
6. For each element, check if subtracting the current element from x results in a non-negative value.
7. If x remains non-negative, subtract the current element from x and increment num.
8. If x becomes negative, stop iterating.
9. If num equals N and x is greater than 0, decrement num by 1.
10. Output the value of num.
