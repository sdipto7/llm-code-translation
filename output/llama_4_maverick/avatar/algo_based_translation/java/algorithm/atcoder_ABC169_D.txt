1. Read input number n.
2. Calculate the square root of n and store it in sqrt.
3. Initialize answer to 0.
4. Iterate from i = 2 to sqrt.
5. For each i, count the number of times n is divisible by i.
6. For the count obtained in step 5, iterate from j = 1 until count - j is less than 0.
7. In each iteration of step 6, decrement count by j and increment answer by 1.
8. After step 4, check if n is greater than 1.
9. If n is greater than 1, increment answer by 1.
10. Output the value of answer.
