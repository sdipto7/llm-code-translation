1. Read the number of inputs, n.
2. Read n numbers and store them in an array.
3. Sort the array in ascending order.
4. Initialize a variable, count, with the value of the largest number in the array.
5. Iterate through the array from the second last element to the first.
6. For each element, check if it is less than the next element.
7. If it is less, add it to count.
8. If it is not less, decrement it until it is less than the next element.
9. If the decremented element is greater than 0, add it to count.
10. Output the final value of count.
