1. Read an integer n from the input.
2. Output the value of n.
3. Initialize a variable m with the value of n.
4. Iterate from n-1 down to 1.
5. For each iteration, check if m is divisible by the current number i.
6. If m is divisible by i, output the value of i and update m to be i.
7. Continue iterating until i reaches 1.
