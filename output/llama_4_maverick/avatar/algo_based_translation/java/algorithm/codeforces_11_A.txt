1. Read two integers n and d from the input.
2. Initialize an array of size n to store integers.
3. Read n integers from the input and store them in the array.
4. Initialize a variable result to 0.
5. Iterate through the array from the second element to the last element.
6. For each element, calculate the difference between the current element and its previous element.
7. If the difference is greater than or equal to 0, calculate the number of times d fits into the difference and add 1 to it.
8. Add the calculated value to result.
9. Update the current element by adding the product of the calculated value and d to it.
10. After iterating through the entire array, output the value of result.
