1. Read input string from the input stream.
2. Initialize an array `cum` of size equal to the length of the input string plus one with all elements set to 0.
3. Iterate through the input string from the second character to the last character.
4. For each character, check if it is equal to the previous character.
5. If they are equal, increment the corresponding cumulative sum in `cum` by 1; otherwise, copy the previous cumulative sum.
6. Read the number of queries `q` from the input stream.
7. Iterate `q` times.
8. In each iteration, read two integers `l` and `r` representing a query range from the input stream.
9. Subtract 1 from `r`.
10. Calculate the result for the query by subtracting the cumulative sum at `l - 1` from the cumulative sum at `r`.
11. Output the result for the query to the output stream.
12. Close the output stream.
