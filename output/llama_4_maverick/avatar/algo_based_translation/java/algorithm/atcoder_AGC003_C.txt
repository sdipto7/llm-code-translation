1. Initialize a HashMap to store numbers and their indices.
2. Initialize a PriorityQueue to store numbers.
3. Read the number of elements N.
4. For i from 0 to N-1:
   4.1. Read a number.
   4.2. Add the number to the PriorityQueue.
   4.3. Store the number and its index in the HashMap.
5. Initialize a binary counter bin to 0.
6. Initialize a difference counter diff to 0.
7. While the PriorityQueue is not empty:
   7.1. Remove the smallest number from the PriorityQueue.
   7.2. Retrieve the index of the removed number from the HashMap.
   7.3. If the parity of bin is different from the parity of the index:
      7.3.1. Increment diff.
   7.4. Increment bin modulo 2.
8. Calculate the answer as diff divided by 2.
9. Output the answer.
