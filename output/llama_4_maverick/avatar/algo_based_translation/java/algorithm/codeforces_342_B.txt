1. Read input values: n, m, s, f.
2. Initialize maxT to -1.
3. Create an empty HashMap to store time-stamped intervals.
4. Iterate m times:
   4.1. Read time-stamped interval: t, a, b.
   4.2. Store the interval (a, b) in the HashMap at key t.
   4.3. Update maxT to be the maximum of maxT and t.
5. Initialize a StringBuilder to store the sequence of actions.
6. Determine the direction of movement (M) based on whether s is less than f.
7. Initialize the current position (cur) to s and the direction of movement (d) based on whether s is less than f.
8. Iterate from t = 1 to maxT:
   8.1. Check if there is an interval stored in the HashMap at time t.
   8.2. If an interval exists and the current position or the next position is within the interval, append 'X' to the actions StringBuilder.
   8.3. Otherwise, append the direction of movement (M) to the actions StringBuilder and update the current position.
   8.4. If the current position equals f, break the loop.
9. While the current position is not equal to f:
   9.1. Append the direction of movement (M) to the actions StringBuilder.
   9.2. Update the current position.
10. Output the sequence of actions stored in the StringBuilder.
