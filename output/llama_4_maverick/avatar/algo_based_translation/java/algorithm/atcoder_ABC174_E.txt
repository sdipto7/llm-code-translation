1. Initialize input and output streams.
2. Create an input reader and a print writer.
3. Instantiate a solution object.
4. Call the solve method on the solution object, passing the input reader and print writer.
5. Read two integers, n and k, using the input reader.
6. Read an array of n integers, logsLength, using the input reader.
7. Initialize two variables, min and max, to 1 and a large number (1e9 + 1000), respectively.
8. Perform a binary search between min and max.
9. In each iteration of the binary search, calculate the midpoint, mid.
10. Check if the condition nei(mid, logsLength, k) is true.
11. If nei(mid, logsLength, k) is true, update max to mid.
12. If nei(mid, logsLength, k) is false, update min to mid + 1.
13. Continue the binary search until min is no longer less than max.
14. Once the binary search ends, print the value of min using the print writer.
15. Close the print writer.
16. In the nei method, iterate through each log in logsLength.
17. For each log, subtract the number of cuts required ((log + mid - 1) / mid - 1) from k.
18. Return true if k is greater than or equal to 0 after iterating through all logs; otherwise, return false.
