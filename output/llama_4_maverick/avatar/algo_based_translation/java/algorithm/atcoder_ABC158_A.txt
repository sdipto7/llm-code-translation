1. Read input from the input stream.
2. Create a scanner object to parse the input.
3. Create a print writer object to write to the output stream.
4. Initialize an instance of the AStationAndBus class.
5. Call the solve method on the AStationAndBus instance, passing 1, the scanner object, and the print writer object.
6. In the solve method, read a string from the input using the scanner object.
7. Check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'.
8. If the string contains both 'A' and 'B', write "Yes" to the output using the print writer object.
9. If the string does not contain both 'A' and 'B', write "No" to the output using the print writer object.
10. Close the print writer object to finalize the output.
