1. Initialize a scanner to read input from the standard input stream.
2. Initialize a writer to write output to the standard output stream.
3. Read three input values: an integer r, an integer d, and a long integer x.
4. Iterate 10 times.
5. In each iteration, update the value of x using the formula: x = r * x - d.
6. Write the updated value of x to the output stream.
7. Close the writer to ensure all output is flushed.
8. End the process.
