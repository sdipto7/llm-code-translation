1. Start
2. Read input from the standard input stream.
3. Parse the input into a double value.
4. Calculate the count of odd numbers by dividing the input by 2 and rounding to the nearest integer.
5. Calculate the result by dividing the count of odd numbers by the input.
6. Set the scale of the result to 10 decimal places with rounding mode HALF_UP.
7. Print the result to the standard output stream.
8. If an IOException or NumberFormatException occurs during input parsing, catch the exception, print the error stack trace, and exit the program with status code 0.
9. If any other exception occurs, catch the exception, print the error stack trace, and exit the program with status code 0.
