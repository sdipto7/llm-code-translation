1. Read two integers n and k from the input.
2. Initialize variables l to 0 and c to 1.
3. Iterate n times:
   3.1. Read an integer a from the input.
   3.2. If a equals l, increment c by 1.
   3.3. Otherwise, set c to 1.
   3.4. Update l to a.
4. If the sum of c and k is greater than n, proceed to step 5; otherwise, proceed to step 6.
5. Output the difference between n and c.
6. Output -1.
