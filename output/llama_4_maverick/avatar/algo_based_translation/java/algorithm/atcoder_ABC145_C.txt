1. Read the number of points N from the input.
2. Initialize a 2D array pos of size N x 2 to store the coordinates of N points.
3. For i = 0 to N-1, read the x and y coordinates of the ith point and store them in pos[i][0] and pos[i][1] respectively.
4. Initialize a variable sum to 0.
5. For i = 0 to N-1, iterate through each point.
6. For j = 0 to N-1, iterate through each point again.
7. If i == j, skip to the next iteration.
8. Calculate the Euclidean distance between the ith and jth points using the dist function.
9. Add the calculated distance to sum.
10. Calculate the average distance by dividing sum by N.
11. Output the average distance. 

dist(x1, y1, x2, y2):
1. Calculate the difference in x-coordinates (x1 - x2) and y-coordinates (y1 - y2).
2. Square the differences and sum them.
3. Calculate the square root of the sum.
4. Return the result.
