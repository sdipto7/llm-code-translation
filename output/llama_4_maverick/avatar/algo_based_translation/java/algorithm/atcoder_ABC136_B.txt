1. Read input N from the standard input.
2. Initialize count to 0 and temp to N.
3. While temp is greater than 0, divide temp by 10 and increment count by 1.
4. Initialize ans to 0.
5. For i from 1 to count, perform the following steps:
   6. If i equals count, check if i is odd. If it is, add (N - 10^(i-1) + 1) to ans.
   7. If i is not equal to count, perform the following steps:
      8. If i equals 1, add 9 to ans.
      9. If i is odd and not equal to 1, add (10^i - 10^(i-1)) to ans.
10. Output ans.
