1. Read a line of input from the user and convert it into a character array.
2. Iterate through the character array to find the index of the '.' character.
3. Check if the character preceding the '.' is '9'.
4. If the preceding character is '9', output "GOTO Vasilisa.".
5. If not, parse the character immediately following the '.' into an integer.
6. Check if the parsed integer is greater than 4.
7. If it is greater than 4, create a new string consisting of characters before the '.' in the original array.
8. Convert the new string into a BigInteger, add 1 to it, and output the result as a string.
9. If the parsed integer is not greater than 4, output the characters before the '.' in the original array.
10. End the process.
