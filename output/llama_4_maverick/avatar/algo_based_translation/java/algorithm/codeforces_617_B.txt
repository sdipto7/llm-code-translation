1. Read the number of elements n from the input.
2. Initialize an empty list to store indices.
3. Iterate n times:
   3.1 Read an integer from the input.
   3.2 If the integer is 1, add the current index to the list.
4. If the list is empty, output 0.
5. Otherwise:
   5.1 Initialize a variable result to 1.
   5.2 Iterate through the list starting from the second element:
      5.2.1 Calculate the difference between the current index and the previous index.
      5.2.2 Multiply the result by the calculated difference.
   5.3 Output the final result.
