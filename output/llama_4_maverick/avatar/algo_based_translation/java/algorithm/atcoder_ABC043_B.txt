1. Read input from the input stream.
2. Create a `LightScanner` object to read input and a `PrintWriter` object to write output.
3. Create an instance of `BUnhappyHackingABCEdit`.
4. Call the `solve` method on the `BUnhappyHackingABCEdit` instance, passing 1, the `LightScanner` object, and the `PrintWriter` object.
5. In the `solve` method:
   1. Read a string from the input using the `LightScanner`.
   2. Initialize an empty `StringBuilder`.
   3. Iterate over each character in the input string.
   4. For each character:
      1. If the character is '0' or '1', append it to the `StringBuilder`.
      2. If the character is 'B' and the `StringBuilder` is not empty, remove the last character from the `StringBuilder`.
   5. Print the contents of the `StringBuilder` to the output using the `PrintWriter`.
6. Close the `PrintWriter` to finalize the output.
