1. Initialize a buffer size.
2. Create a scanner object with the specified buffer size to read from the standard input.
3. Create a print writer object with the specified buffer size to write to the standard output.
4. Define a function to calculate the value at a given index using the formula: 1 + ((index - 1) * index / 2).
5. Read a long value representing a position from the standard input.
6. Initialize a variable to store the nearest sequence start index to 1.
7. While the value at twice the current nearest sequence start index is less than the given position, double the nearest sequence start index.
8. While the value at the next index of the current nearest sequence start index is less than or equal to the given position, increment the nearest sequence start index.
9. Calculate the start index of the sequence using the nearest sequence start index.
10. Calculate the result by subtracting the start index from the given position and adding 1.
11. Print the result to the standard output using the print writer object.
12. Close the print writer object.
