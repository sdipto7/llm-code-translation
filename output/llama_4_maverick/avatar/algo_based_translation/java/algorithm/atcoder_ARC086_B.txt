1. Read the number of elements, n.
2. Read n integers into an array, a.
3. Find the index, m, of the element with the maximum absolute value in the array.
4. For each element in the array, if the element and the element at index m have different signs, add the operation (m+1, i+1) to the result list.
5. If the element at index m is non-negative, add operations (i, i+1) for i from 1 to n-1 to the result list.
6. If the element at index m is negative, add operations (i, i-1) for i from n to 2 to the result list.
7. Output the size of the result list.
8. Output each operation in the result list.
