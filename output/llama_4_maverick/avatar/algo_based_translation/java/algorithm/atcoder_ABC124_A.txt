1. Read two integers from the input.
2. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
3. Repeat the following steps 2 times:
   3.1 Compare the two integers.
   3.2 If the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, add the first integer to `sum` and decrement the first integer by 1.
   3.3 Otherwise, add the second integer to `sum` and decrement the second integer by 1.
4. Output the value of `sum`.
