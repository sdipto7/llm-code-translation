1. Initialize a counter variable to 0.
2. Read an integer representing the number of test cases.
3. Loop until the number of test cases is 0.
4. Within the loop, read three integers: a, b, and c.
5. Check if at least two of the integers a, b, or c are equal to 1.
6. If the condition is met, increment the counter variable.
7. Decrement the test case counter.
8. Once the loop finishes, output the value of the counter variable.
