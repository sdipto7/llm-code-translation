1. Initialize a graph with m+1 nodes.
2. Create an adjacency list representation of the graph.
3. Read n edges and add them to the graph.
4. Initialize a boolean array `seen` of size m+1 to keep track of visited nodes.
5. For each unvisited node i from 1 to m:
   1. Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal starting from node i.
   2. During DFS, mark the current node as visited.
   3. For each neighbor of the current node that is not its parent:
      1. Increment a counter for the number of nodes visited in the current DFS traversal.
      2. Recursively perform DFS on the neighbor.
      3. If a cycle is detected during the DFS traversal, return a value indicating a cycle.
   4. If a cycle is detected during the DFS traversal and the count of visited nodes is odd, increment a counter for nodes to be removed.
6. If the total number of nodes minus the number of nodes to be removed is odd, increment the counter for nodes to be removed.
7. Output the total number of nodes to be removed.
