1. Read two strings S and T from the input.
2. Initialize a boolean variable res to true.
3. Define an array A containing all lowercase English letters.
4. Iterate over each character s in array A.
5. Find the index of the first occurrence of s in S.
6. If s is not found in S, skip to the next iteration.
7. Get the character t at the same index in T as s is in S.
8. Initialize a variable idx to 0.
9. Enter a loop that continues until idx is out of bounds of S.
10. Inside the loop, check if s is found in S starting from idx.
11. If s is found, compare its index in S with the index of t in T starting from idx.
12. If the indices do not match, set res to false and exit the loop.
13. If the indices match, update idx to the index of s in S plus one.
14. If s is not found in S but t is found in T starting from idx, set res to false and exit the loop.
15. If neither s nor t is found in S and T respectively starting from idx, exit the loop.
16. If res becomes false, exit the outer loop iterating over A.
17. After iterating over all characters in A or res becomes false, check the value of res.
18. If res is true, output "Yes".
19. If res is false, output "No".
