1. Initialize a modulus value to 10^9 + 7.
2. Read two integers, n and k, from the input.
3. Create a list to store the lengths of certain ranges.
4. Iterate from l = 1 to n, incrementing l to r + 1 in each step, where r is the largest number such that n/l equals n/r.
5. In each iteration, calculate r as n/(n/l) and append (r - l + 1) to the list of lengths.
6. Determine the size of the list of lengths, denoted as q.
7. Create a one-dimensional array dp of size k*(q+1) to store dynamic programming state.
8. Initialize the first q elements of dp such that dp[j] is the sum of the first j elements in the list of lengths.
9. Iterate from i = 1 to k-1.
10. Within each iteration of i, iterate from j = 1 to q.
11. For each (i, j), update dp[i*(q+1) + j] as the sum of dp[i*(q+1) + j - 1] and the product of dp[(i-1)*(q+1) + q - j + 1] and the jth element in the list of lengths.
12. Apply the modulus operation to dp[i*(q+1) + j] to prevent overflow.
13. Output the value of dp[k*(q+1) - 1].
