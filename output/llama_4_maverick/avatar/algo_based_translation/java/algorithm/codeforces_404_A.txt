1. Read the input size n.
2. Read n strings of length n.
3. Convert the input strings into a 2D character array.
4. Identify the characters at the positions (0,0) and (0,1) in the 2D array.
5. Check if the characters identified in step 4 are the same. If they are the same, output "NO".
6. If the characters are different, initialize a flag to true.
7. Iterate over the 2D array. For each element at position (i, j), check the following conditions:
   - If i equals j or i + j equals n - 1, verify that the element is equal to the character at (0,0).
   - If the element is not equal to the character at (0,0), set the flag to false and stop the iteration.
   - If i is not equal to j and i + j is not equal to n - 1, verify that the element is equal to the character at (0,1).
   - If the element is not equal to the character at (0,1), set the flag to false and stop the iteration.
8. After iterating over the entire array, check the flag.
9. If the flag is true, output "YES".
10. If the flag is false, output "NO".
