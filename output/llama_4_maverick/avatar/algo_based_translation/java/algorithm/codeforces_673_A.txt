1. Read the number of inputs, n.
2. Create an empty list to store the inputs.
3. Read n integer values and store them in the list.
4. Check if the first element in the list is greater than 15.
5. If true, set the result to 15.
6. If false, iterate through the list starting from the second element.
7. For each element, check if the difference between the current element and the previous element is greater than 15.
8. If a difference greater than 15 is found, store the index of the previous element and set a flag to 1.
9. Break the iteration.
10. If the flag is 1, set the result to the value at the stored index plus 15.
11. If the flag is still 0 after iteration, set the result to the last element in the list plus 15.
12. Check if the result is greater than 90.
13. If true, set the result to 90.
14. Output the result.
