1. Read input from the input stream.
2. Create an input reader object to read from the input stream.
3. Create a print writer object to write to the output stream.
4. Initialize a task solver object.
5. Call the solve method on the task solver object with test number 1, input reader, and print writer.
6. In the solve method:
   1. Read a string S from the input reader.
   2. Initialize a score variable to 0.
   3. Iterate over each character in the string S.
   4. For each character at index i:
      1. Determine the expected character 'my' based on whether i is even or odd.
      2. Get the actual character 'his' at index i from the string S.
      3. If 'my' is not equal to 'his':
         1. Increment the score by 1 if 'my' is 'p'.
         2. Decrement the score by 1 if 'my' is not 'p'.
   5. Print the final score using the print writer.
7. Close the print writer to finalize the output.
