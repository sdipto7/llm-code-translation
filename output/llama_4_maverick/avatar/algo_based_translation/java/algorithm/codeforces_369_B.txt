1. Read input values: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk.
2. Initialize an array 'ans' of size n with all elements set to l.
3. Subtract (n - k) * l from sAll.
4. Subtract k * l from sk.
5. Distribute the remaining sk among the last k elements of 'ans' by incrementing them one by one until sk becomes 0.
6. Distribute the remaining sAll among the first (n - k) elements of 'ans' by incrementing them one by one until sAll becomes 0.
7. Output the elements of 'ans'.
