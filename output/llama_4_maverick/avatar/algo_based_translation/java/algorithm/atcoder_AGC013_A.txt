1. Read the number of elements N from the input.
2. Initialize an array A of size N.
3. Read N integers from the input and store them in array A.
4. Initialize a counter variable count to 0.
5. Iterate through array A from index 0 to N-1.
6. For the last element (i = N-1), increment count by 1.
7. For other elements, check if the current element is equal to the next element. If so, do nothing.
8. If the current element is less than the next element, increment i until the current element is greater than the next element or i reaches N-1, then increment count by 1.
9. If the current element is greater than the next element, increment i until the current element is less than the next element or i reaches N-1, then increment count by 1.
10. Output the value of count.
