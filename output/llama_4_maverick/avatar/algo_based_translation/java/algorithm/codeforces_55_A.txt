1. Initialize a Scanner object to read from the standard input.
2. Declare and initialize variables: n, i, k, p, flag, and an integer array a of size 1000.
3. Read an integer n from the standard input.
4. Set i to 0.
5. Enter a while loop that continues as long as k is less than or equal to n.
6. Inside the loop, increment i by k.
7. Check if i is greater than or equal to n. If true, enter a nested while loop.
8. Inside the nested loop, decrement i by n until i is less than n.
9. Increment the value in the array a at index i.
10. Increment k by 1.
11. Exit the while loop when k exceeds n.
12. Iterate through the array a from index 0 to n-1.
13. Inside the loop, check if the value at the current index i is 0. If true, set flag to false and break the loop.
14. Check the value of flag. If true, output "YES". Otherwise, output "NO".
