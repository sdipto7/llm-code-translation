1. Read the input modulus number.
2. Read the number of elements 'n' from the input.
3. Create two lists 'ai' and 'bi' to store the input pairs.
4. Read 'n' pairs of integers from the input and store them in 'ai' and 'bi'.
5. Sort 'ai' and 'bi' in ascending order.
6. If 'n' is odd, calculate the difference between the middle elements of 'bi' and 'ai', then add 1.
7. If 'n' is even, calculate the average of the two middle elements in 'ai' and 'bi'.
8. For 'n' even, calculate the difference between the averages of 'bi' and 'ai', multiply by 2, and then add 1.
9. Output the calculated result.
10. Close the output stream.
