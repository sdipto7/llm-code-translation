1. Read the input year.
2. Check if the input year is a leap year.
3. Initialize a sum to 0.
4. Start a loop from the next year of the input year.
5. For each year in the loop, check if it is a leap year.
6. If the year is a leap year, add 366 to the sum; otherwise, add 365.
7. Check if the sum is divisible by 7.
8. If the sum is divisible by 7, check if the current year's leap status matches the input year's leap status.
9. If the leap statuses match, output the current year and stop.
10. If the leap statuses do not match, continue to the next iteration of the loop.
