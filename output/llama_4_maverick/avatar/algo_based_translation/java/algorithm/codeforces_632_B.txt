1. Read the number of elements 'n' from the input.
2. Read 'n' integers into an array 'a'.
3. Read a string 's' of length 'n' from the input.
4. Initialize a variable 'sum' to 0.
5. Iterate through the string 's' and for each character at index 'i', if the character is 'B', add the value of 'a[i]' to 'sum'.
6. Initialize 'ans' with the value of 'sum'.
7. Initialize 'sum1' with the value of 'sum'.
8. Iterate through the string 's' from left to right. For each character at index 'i', if the character is 'A', add 'a[i]' to 'sum1', otherwise subtract 'a[i]' from 'sum1'. Update 'ans' with the maximum of 'ans' and 'sum1'.
9. Reset 'sum1' to the initial 'sum'.
10. Iterate through the string 's' from right to left. For each character at index 'i', if the character is 'A', add 'a[i]' to 'sum1', otherwise subtract 'a[i]' from 'sum1'. Update 'ans' with the maximum of 'ans' and 'sum1'.
11. Output the value of 'ans'.
