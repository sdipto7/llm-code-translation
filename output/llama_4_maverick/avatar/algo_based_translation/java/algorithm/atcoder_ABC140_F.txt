1. Read the input value N from the input.
2. Calculate the value of size as 2^N.
3. Initialize an array S of size 'size' to store integers.
4. Initialize a boolean array 'spawned' of size 'size' to track spawned elements.
5. Set the last element of 'spawned' to true.
6. Read 'size' number of integers from the input and store them in array S.
7. Sort the array S in ascending order.
8. Initialize a list 'active' with the last element of S.
9. Iterate N times:
   1. Sort the 'active' list in descending order.
   2. Initialize an empty list 'activated' to store newly activated elements.
   3. Initialize a variable 'next' to the last index of S.
   4. Iterate through each element 'slime' in 'active':
      1. Decrement 'next' until S[next] is less than 'slime' and S[next] is not spawned.
      2. If 'next' is less than 0, output "No" and terminate.
      3. Mark S[next] as spawned.
      4. Add S[next] to 'activated'.
   5. Add all elements of 'activated' to 'active'.
10. Output "Yes".
