1. Initialize minimum value to maximum possible long integer value.
2. Read four long integer numbers and store them in a list.
3. Read three operation strings and store them in an array.
4. Define a recursive utility function that takes a list of numbers, an array of operations, and an index as parameters.
5. In the utility function, check if the index is equal to 3.
6. If the index is 3, update the minimum value with the minimum of the current minimum and the first element of the list.
7. If the index is not 3, iterate over all pairs of numbers in the list.
8. For each pair, create a new list containing the numbers not in the pair and the result of applying the operation at the current index to the pair.
9. Recursively call the utility function with the new list, the same operations array, and the index incremented by 1.
10. Call the utility function with the initial list of numbers, the operations array, and an index of 0.
11. Output the final minimum value.
