1. Read the number of points N from the input.
2. Read N pairs of coordinates (x, y) from the input and store them in two separate arrays.
3. Iterate over each point i from 0 to N-1.
4. For each point i, create a list to store the angles of other points relative to it.
5. Iterate over each point j from 0 to N-1, excluding point i.
6. Calculate the angle of point j relative to point i using atan2(y[j] - y[i], x[j] - x[i]) and add it to the list.
7. Sort the list of angles in ascending order.
8. Append the first angle plus 2π to the end of the list.
9. Initialize a variable to store the maximum angle difference.
10. Iterate over the sorted list of angles.
11. For each angle k, calculate the difference between the next angle and the current angle minus π.
12. Update the maximum angle difference if the calculated difference is larger.
13. Calculate the final answer by dividing the maximum angle difference by 2π.
14. Output the final answer.
15. Repeat steps 3-14 for each point.
