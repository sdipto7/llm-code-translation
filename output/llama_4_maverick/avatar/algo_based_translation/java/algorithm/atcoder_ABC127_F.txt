1. Initialize output stream and print writer.
2. Read input from buffered reader.
3. Parse the number of test cases.
4. Initialize two priority queues (max and min heaps) and variables to track sums and minimum value.
5. Iterate through each test case.
6. If the input command is '2', calculate the answer using the current state of the priority queues and sums.
7. Print the minimum value and the calculated answer.
8. If the input command is not '2', parse the input values (in and sumb).
9. Add the sumb to the total sumb.
10. Insert the value 'in' into the appropriate priority queue based on its comparison with the current minimum value.
11. Update the sums accordingly.
12. Rebalance the priority queues to maintain a size difference of at most 1.
13. Update the minimum value.
14. Repeat steps 5-13 until all test cases are processed.
15. Close the output stream.
