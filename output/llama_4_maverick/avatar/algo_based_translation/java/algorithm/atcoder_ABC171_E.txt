1. Read the number of elements, n, from the input.
2. Initialize an array, a, of size n to store the input elements.
3. Initialize a variable, r, to 0 to store the XOR of all elements.
4. Iterate from 0 to n-1 and for each iteration:
   4.1. Read an element from the input and store it in a[i].
   4.2. Update r by performing XOR operation between r and a[i].
5. Iterate from 0 to n-1 and for each iteration:
   5.1. Calculate the XOR of r and a[i].
   5.2. If i is not 0, print a space before printing the result of the XOR operation.
   5.3. Print the result of the XOR operation.
