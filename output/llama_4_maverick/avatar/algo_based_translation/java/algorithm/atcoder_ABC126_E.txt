1. Read the number of elements `n` from the input.
2. Initialize a Union-Find Tree data structure with `n` elements.
3. Read the number of operations `m` from the input.
4. For `m` times, perform the following steps:
   4.1. Read three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the input.
   4.2. Subtract 1 from `x` and `y`.
   4.3. Unite the sets containing `x` and `y` using the Union-Find Tree.
5. Initialize a counter `cnt` to 0.
6. For each element `i` from 0 to `n-1`, perform the following step:
   6.1. If `i` is the representative of its set in the Union-Find Tree, increment `cnt` by 1.
7. Output the value of `cnt`. 

### Union-Find Tree Operations:
1. Initialize the Union-Find Tree with `n` elements, where each element is initially in its own set.
2. To find the representative of an element `x`, perform the following steps:
   2.1. If `x` is the representative of its set, return `x`.
   2.2. Otherwise, recursively find the representative of the parent of `x` and update the parent of `x` to the representative.
3. To unite two sets containing `x` and `y`, perform the following steps:
   3.1. Find the representatives of `x` and `y`.
   3.2. If the representatives are the same, return.
   3.3. Otherwise, merge the two sets by making one representative the parent of the other based on their ranks.
   3.4. Update the rank of the new representative if necessary.
