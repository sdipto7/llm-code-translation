1. Read input from the user.
2. Parse the input into two integers, n and m.
3. Initialize an array of strings, ans, of size n.
4. Iterate n times.
5. In each iteration, read a string of length m.
6. For each character in the string, check if it is '-'.
7. If it is '-', append '-' to a temporary string.
8. If it is not '-', check if the sum of the current row index and column index is odd.
9. If the sum is odd, append 'W' to the temporary string.
10. If the sum is even, append 'B' to the temporary string.
11. Store the temporary string in the ans array.
12. Iterate through the ans array and print each string.
