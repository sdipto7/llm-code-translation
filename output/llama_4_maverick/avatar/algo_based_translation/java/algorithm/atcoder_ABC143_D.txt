1. Read the number of elements N from the input.
2. Create a list L to store N integers.
3. Read N integers from the input and store them in L.
4. Sort the list L in ascending order.
5. Initialize a counter count to 0.
6. Iterate over each element at index i in L.
7. For each element at index i, iterate over each element at index j in L, where j > i.
8. For each pair of elements at indices i and j, calculate their sum a + b.
9. Find the number of elements in L, starting from index j + 1, that are less than the sum a + b using a binary search function.
10. Add the result of the binary search to the counter count.
11. After iterating over all pairs of elements, output the value of count.
12. The binary search function takes a list, a starting index, and a target value as inputs.
13. Initialize two pointers, low and upp, to the starting index and the last index of the list, respectively.
14. Calculate the mid index based on low and upp.
15. If the difference between upp and low is less than 0, return 0.
16. If the element at the starting index is greater than or equal to the target, return 0.
17. If the element at index upp is less than the target, return upp - low + 1.
18. While the difference between upp and low is greater than 1, update low or upp based on the comparison between the element at mid and the target.
19. Update mid based on the new values of low and upp.
20. Return low - starting index + 1.
