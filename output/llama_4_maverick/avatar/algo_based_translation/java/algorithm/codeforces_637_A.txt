1. Read the number of elements, n.
2. Initialize an array, ara, of size n to store the input elements.
3. Create a map to store the frequency of each element in the array.
4. Iterate through the array, storing each input element in ara and updating its frequency in the map.
5. Find the maximum frequency of any element in the map.
6. Create another map, mm, to track the frequency of elements as they are iterated through ara again.
7. Iterate through ara again, updating the frequency of each element in mm.
8. Check if the frequency of the current element in mm equals the maximum frequency found earlier.
9. If the frequency matches the maximum, print the element and stop iterating.
10. End the process.
