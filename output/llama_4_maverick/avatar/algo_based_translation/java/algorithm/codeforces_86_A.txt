1. Define a function to calculate the number of digits in a given number.
2. Calculate the number of digits in the input number using the function defined in step 1.
3. Define a function to compute the product of a number and the difference between a number consisting of a sequence of 9's (with the same number of digits as the input number) and the input number.
4. Read two long integers, l and r, representing a range.
5. Initialize a variable res to store the maximum product.
6. Precompute the maximum product for numbers consisting of a sequence of 9's divided by 2 and store them in an array maxxes.
7. Update res with the maximum product between mult(l) and mult(r).
8. Iterate through the precomputed maxxes array and check if the number corresponding to each maxxes value falls within the range [l, r].
9. Update res with the maximum value between the current res and the maxxes value if the corresponding number is within the range.
10. Output the final value of res.
