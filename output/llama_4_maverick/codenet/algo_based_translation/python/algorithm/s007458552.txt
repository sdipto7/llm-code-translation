1. Import required libraries: 
   - sys
   - collections (specifically Counter and defaultdict)

2. Define constants:
   - INF as float('inf')
   - MOD as 10^9 + 7

3. Define input helper functions:
   - LI(): returns a list of integers from a line of input
   - LI_(): returns a list of integers from a line of input, subtracting 1 from each integer
   - LS(): returns a list of strings from a line of input
   - II(): returns an integer from a line of input
   - SI(): returns a string from a line of input

4. Define main function:
   - main(): 
     1. Read an integer n from input using II()
     2. Read a string S from input using SI()
     3. Count the occurrences of each character in S using Counter(S)
     4. Compare the count of 'R' to n minus the count of 'R'
     5. Return 'Yes' if count of 'R' is greater, 'No' otherwise

5. Print the result of main() to output.
