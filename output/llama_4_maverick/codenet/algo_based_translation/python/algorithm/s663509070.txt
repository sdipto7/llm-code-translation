1. Read two integer inputs, N and D, from the user, where N and D are separated by a space.
2. Declare an empty list, mat, to store the input matrix.
3. Iterate N times:
   - Read D integer inputs from the user, separated by spaces.
   - Store these D integers as a list in mat.
4. Initialize a counter variable, c, to 0.
5. Iterate over each pair of distinct lists (mat[i], mat[j]) in mat:
   - Calculate the Euclidean distance between mat[i] and mat[j] using their corresponding elements.
   - Check if the calculated distance is an integer.
   - If it is an integer, increment c by 1.
6. Output the value of c.
