1. Define a function `count_segments` with no parameters and return type integer.
2. Declare variable `n` of type integer.
3. Read an integer input from the user and store it in `n`.
4. Declare variable `s` of type string.
5. Read a string input from the user and store it in `s`.
6. Declare variable `cnt` of type integer and initialize it to 1.
7. Start a for loop iterating from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive).
8. Inside the loop, compare the character at index `i` and `i+1` in string `s`.
9. If the characters are equal, continue to the next iteration.
10. If the characters are not equal, increment `cnt` by 1.
11. After the loop finishes, print the value of `cnt`.
12. The program terminates. 
 Required libraries: built-in input/output functions.
