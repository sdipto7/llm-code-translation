### Algorithm

1. Define a function `solve()` with no parameters and return type `void`.
2. Declare variables:
   - `S_d`: a list of characters (string) to store the input string.
   - `T`: a list of characters (string) to store the target string.
   - `end`: an integer to store the ending index.
   - `first`: an integer to store the starting index.
   - `t_i`: an integer to store the index for `T`.
   - `s_i`: an integer to store the index for `S_d`.
   - `ans`: a list of characters (string) to store the answer.

3. Read input strings into `S_d` and `T`.
4. Initialize `end` to the last index of `S_d` and `first` to `end - len(T) + 1`.
5. While `first >= 0`:
   - Iterate through `S_d` from `first` to `end` and compare characters with `T`.
   - If a mismatch is found and the character in `S_d` is not '?', break the loop.
   - If the loop completes without a mismatch, break the while loop.
   - Decrement `first` and `end` by 1.
6. If the while loop completes without finding a match, print 'UNRESTORABLE' and exit.
7. Create a deep copy of `S_d` in `ans`.
8. Iterate through `T` and replace the corresponding characters in `ans` from `first` to `end` with characters from `T`.
9. Replace all '?' in `ans` with 'a' and join the characters into a string.
10. Print the resulting string.
