1. Define a function `main` with no parameters and no return type.
2. Declare variables `a` and `b` of type integer.
3. Read two integer values from standard input, separated by a space, and store them in `a` and `b` respectively.
4. Declare a list `x` to store results of operations on `a` and `b`.
5. Calculate the sum of `a` and `b`, store it in the list `x`.
6. Calculate the difference of `a` and `b`, append it to the list `x`.
7. Calculate the product of `a` and `b`, append it to the list `x`.
8. Find the maximum value in the list `x`.
9. Print the maximum value to standard output.
