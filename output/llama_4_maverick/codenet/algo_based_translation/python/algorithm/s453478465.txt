1. Declare variables a and b of type integer.
2. Read input from the user and split it into two parts.
3. Convert the input parts to integers and assign them to a and b.
4. Check the condition: if a is less than or equal to 8 and b is less than or equal to 8.
5. If the condition is true, output the string "Yay!".
6. If the condition is false, output the string ":(". 
7. Terminate the program. 

Alternatively, in a more formal algorithmic representation:
- Procedure Main()
  - Declare a, b: integer
  - Input(a, b)
  - If (a <= 8) AND (b <= 8) Then
    - Output("Yay!")
  - Else
    - Output(":(")
  - End If
- End Procedure

In terms of function signature:
- Function Main(): void
  - Input: Read two integers from the user.
  - Output: Print "Yay!" or ":(" based on the condition. 

Required libraries or modules: Input/Output operations (built-in).
