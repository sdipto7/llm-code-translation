1. Import required libraries: sys
2. Define input functions:
   - input(): reads a line from standard input, removes trailing newline, and returns the result as a string
   - input_nums(): reads a line from standard input, splits it into substrings separated by whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and returns the results as a list of integers
3. Define main function: main() with no parameters and no return value
   1. Read two integers K and N from standard input using input_nums() and store them in variables K and N
   2. Read N integers from standard input using input_nums() and store them in a list A
   3. Initialize an empty list dist
   4. Iterate over the indices of A from 0 to N-2 (inclusive) using a for loop
      1. Calculate the difference between consecutive elements A[i+1] and A[i] and append it to dist
   5. Calculate the difference between K+A[0] and A[-1] and append it to dist
   6. Find the maximum value in dist and store it in maxv
   7. Calculate the sum of all elements in dist and subtract maxv from it
   8. Print the result to standard output
4. Check if the script is being run directly (not being imported) using if __name__ == '__main__': 
   1. Call the main() function

Required libraries: sys 

Data types:
- K: integer
- N: integer
- A: list of integers
- dist: list of integers
- maxv: integer 

Function signatures:
- input(): -> string
- input_nums(): -> list of integers
- main(): -> None
