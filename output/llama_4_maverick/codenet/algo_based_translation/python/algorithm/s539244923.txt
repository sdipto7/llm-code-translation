1. Define a function `calculate_result` with two integer parameters `n` and `k`, returning an integer.
2. Read two integer inputs from the user and store them in `n` and `k` respectively.
3. Check if `k` is divisible by `n` by evaluating the condition `k % n == 0`.
4. If the condition is true, calculate the result as `n + k`.
5. If the condition is false, calculate the result as `k - n`.
6. Print the calculated result.
7. The required input operation is reading two integers from the standard input.
8. The necessary library is the built-in input/output functionality. 

More formally:
- Function signature: `calculate_result(n: int, k: int) -> int`
- Variable declarations: `n: int`, `k: int`, `result: int`
- Execution order:
  1. Read `n` and `k` from input.
  2. Evaluate `k % n == 0`.
  3. If true, `result = n + k`.
  4. If false, `result = k - n`.
  5. Print `result`.
- Control structure: Conditional statement with condition `k % n == 0`.
- Input/Output: Read two integers from input, print one integer to output.
- Libraries/Modules: Built-in Python input/output functionality.
