1. Define a function `can_catch` with parameters `a`, `v`, `b`, `w`, and `t` of type integers and return type string.
2. Read three lines of input: 
   - First line: two integers `a` and `v` separated by space.
   - Second line: two integers `b` and `w` separated by space.
   - Third line: one integer `t`.
3. Declare variables `a`, `v`, `b`, `w`, and `t` as integers.
4. Check if `a` equals `b`. If true, return 'YES'.
5. Check if `v` is less than or equal to `w`. If true, return 'NO'.
6. Calculate the absolute difference between `a` and `b` divided by the difference between `v` and `w`.
7. Check if `t` is less than the result from step 6. If true, return 'NO'. Otherwise, return 'YES'.
8. The required input operations are reading three lines with specified formats.
9. The required library is the built-in input/output functionality.
