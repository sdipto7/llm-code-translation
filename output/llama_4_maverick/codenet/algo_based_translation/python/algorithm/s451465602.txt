1. Define a function `time_conversion` with no parameters and return type `void`.
2. Declare integer variables `n`, `h`, `m`, `s`.
3. Read an integer input from the user and store it in `n`.
4. Calculate `h` by performing integer division of `n` by 3600.
5. Update `n` to be the remainder of `n` divided by 3600.
6. Calculate `m` by performing integer division of `n` by 60.
7. Update `n` to be the remainder of `n` divided by 60.
8. Assign the value of `n` to `s`.
9. Print the string representation of `h`, followed by a colon (:), then the string representation of `m`, another colon (:), and finally the string representation of `s`.
10. The required library for this algorithm is the input/output library, which in Python is included by default.
