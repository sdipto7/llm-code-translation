1. Read an integer N from input.
2. Declare a list A to store two lists of integers.
3. For 2 iterations:
   3.1. Read a list of integers from input, split by spaces, and map to integers.
   3.2. Append the list to A.
4. Initialize an empty list ans to store results.
5. For i ranging from 0 to N-1:
   5.1. Assign the first list in A to baselis.
   5.2. Assign the second list in A to groundlis.
   5.3. Initialize count to 0.
   5.4. Calculate count as the sum of the first i+1 elements in baselis and the sum of elements from index i to N in groundlis.
   5.5. Append count to ans.
6. Find the maximum value in ans.
7. Output the maximum value.
