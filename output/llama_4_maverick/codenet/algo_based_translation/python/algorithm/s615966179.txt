1. Define a function `calculate_result` with parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` of type integer and return type integer.
2. Read three integer inputs from the user and store them in variables `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. Calculate the integer division of `n` by the sum of `a` and `b`, multiply the result by `a`, and store it in variable `ans`.
4. Calculate the remainder of `n` divided by the sum of `a` and `b`, find the minimum between this remainder and `a`, and store it in variable `r`.
5. Add `r` to `ans`.
6. Output the value of `ans`.
7. The required input is three integers, and the output is one integer. 
8. The built-in functions and operations used are `map`, `int`, `input`, `split`, integer division `//`, modulus `%`, and `min`. 
9. The execution order is: input operation, calculation of `ans`, calculation of `r`, update of `ans`, and output operation.
