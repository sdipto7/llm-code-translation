1. Read two integers N and M from standard input.
2. Read M integers from standard input into a list A.
3. Sort list A in descending order.
4. Calculate the sum S of all elements in list A.
5. Iterate over the first M elements of sorted list A.
6. For each element a, check if the condition (a/S) - (1/(4*M)) < 0 is true.
7. If the condition is true for any element, output 'No' and terminate.
8. If the iteration completes without finding any element that satisfies the condition, output 'Yes'. 
9. The program uses the sys module for input operations. 
The input is expected to be in the format: two integers on the first line, followed by a list of integers on the second line.
