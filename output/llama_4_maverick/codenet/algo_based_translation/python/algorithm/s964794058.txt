1. Read an integer input representing the number of members (memTime).
2. Read a list of integers representing the late times of members (memLate).
3. Initialize an empty list (colorList) to store unique colors.
4. Initialize two counters: memColor = 0 and highLate = 0.
5. Iterate over the range of memTime.
6. For each member, calculate the color by performing integer division of the late time by 400.
7. If the calculated color is greater than or equal to 8, increment highLate.
8. If the calculated color is not already in colorList, append it to colorList.
9. After iterating over all members, calculate maxColor as the sum of the length of colorList and highLate.
10. Calculate minColor as the length of colorList. If minColor is 0, set it to 1.
11. Output the values of minColor and maxColor.
