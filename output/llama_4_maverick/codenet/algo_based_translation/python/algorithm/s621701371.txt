1. Read input string `s` from the user.
2. Read the number of operations `q` from the user and convert it to an integer.
3. Read `q` operations from the user, where each operation is a list of strings, and store them in `qs`.
4. Initialize a boolean flag `n` to `False`, and two empty strings `left` and `right`.
5. Iterate over each operation in `qs`.
   1. If the operation is '1', toggle the value of `n`.
   2. If the operation is '2', extract the target `f` and character `c` from the operation.
      1. Convert `f` to an integer.
      2. If `n` is `True`, toggle the value of `f` between 1 and 2.
      3. If `f` is 1, prepend `c` to `left`.
      4. If `f` is 2, append `c` to `right`.
6. Concatenate `left`, `s`, and `right` to form the modified string.
7. If `n` is `True`, reverse the modified string.
8. Output the resulting string.
