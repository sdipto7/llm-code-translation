1. Import the numpy library as np.
2. Read two integer inputs from the user and store them in variables n and k.
3. Compare the values of n and k.
   - If n is greater than k, calculate the remainder of n divided by k and store it in tmp.
     - If tmp is greater than or equal to k - tmp, set ans to k - tmp.
     - Otherwise, set ans to tmp.
   - If n is less than k, 
     - If n is greater than or equal to k - n, set ans to k - n.
     - Otherwise, set ans to n.
   - If n is equal to k, set ans to 0.
4. Output the value of ans.
5. The required library is numpy, but it is not used in the code. The actual required functionality is the input() function and the map() function which are built-in Python functions.
