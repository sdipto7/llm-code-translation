1. Read an integer N from input.
2. Read N integers from input and store them in an array A.
3. Initialize a variable ans with the absolute value of the last element of A.
4. Prepend and append a 0 to the array A.
5. Create an array diff of size N and initialize all elements to 0.
6. Iterate from i = 1 to N (inclusive) and for each i:
   - Calculate dif = |A[i] - A[i-1]| + |A[i] - A[i+1]| - |A[i-1] - A[i+1]|.
   - Add |A[i] - A[i-1]| to ans.
   - Store dif in diff[i-1].
7. Iterate from i = 0 to N-1 and for each i:
   - Print ans - diff[i].
