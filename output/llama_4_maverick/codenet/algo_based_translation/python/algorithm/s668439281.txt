1. Read an integer `n` from input.
2. Initialize an empty list `ls` to store `n` input strings.
3. For `n` iterations, read a string from input and append it to `ls`.
4. Create a `Counter` object `c` from the list `ls` to count the frequency of each string.
5. Retrieve the count of the most common string(s) by accessing the first element of the `most_common()` list of `c`, stored in `count`.
6. Initialize an empty list `ans` to store the most common string(s).
7. Iterate over the `most_common()` list `p` of `c`.
8. For each iteration, check if the count of the current string is equal to `count`.
9. If the counts are equal, append the string to `ans`.
10. If the counts are not equal, break the loop.
11. Sort the list `ans` in ascending order.
12. Iterate over the sorted `ans` list and print each string.
