1. Import the `math` module.
2. Define a function `main()` with no parameters and no return type.
3. Within `main()`, read an input string `N` and discard its value.
4. Read a string of space-separated integers, parse them into a list `XS` of integers.
5. Initialize a variable `m` to 9999999999.
6. Iterate over a range of integers `i` from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
7. For each `i`, calculate the sum `c` of the squared differences between each element `x` in `XS` and `i`.
8. If `c` is less than `m`, update `m` to be equal to `c`.
9. After iterating over all `i`, print the final value of `m` to the output.
 
 Function signature: `def main() -> None`
 Variable declarations: 
 - `N`: string
 - `XS`: list of integers
 - `m`: integer
 - `i`: integer
 - `c`: integer
 - `x`: integer

 Required libraries: None (math module is imported but not used) 

 Data processing logic: 
 - Input is read from the standard input.
 - The first line is discarded.
 - The second line is parsed into a list of integers.
 - The sum of squared differences is calculated for each integer in a given range.
 - The minimum sum is found and printed to the standard output.
