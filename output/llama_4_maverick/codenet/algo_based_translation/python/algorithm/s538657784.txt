- Function signature: `func(N: int) -> None`
- Import the `math` module for mathematical operations
- Declare `N` as an integer input from the user
- Declare `sqN` as an integer, calculated as the square root of `N`
- Iterate over a range from 0 to `sqN-1` using a for loop
- Inside the loop, check the condition `N % (sqN-i) == 0`
- If the condition is true, calculate the result as `int(N/(sqN-i)+sqN-i)-2` and print it
- Exit the loop using a break statement after printing the result
- Input operation: Read an integer `N` from the user
- Output operation: Print the calculated result to the console
- Required library: `math` for the `sqrt` function 

Here is the algorithm in a structured format:
```
func(N: int) -> None
  Import math
  sqN = int(math.sqrt(N))
  for i in range(sqN)
    if N % (sqN-i) == 0
      result = int(N/(sqN-i)+sqN-i)-2
      Print(result)
      Break
  End for
End func

Main
  N = Read integer from user
  func(N)
End Main
```
