1. Read two integer inputs, N and K, from the standard input, separated by a space.
2. Read N integer inputs from the standard input, representing scores, and store them in a list.
3. Initialize two integer variables, mae and usiro, to 0 and K, respectively.
4. Iterate N-K times using a for loop.
5. Inside the loop, compare the score at index mae with the score at index usiro.
6. If the score at index mae is less than the score at index usiro, output 'Yes' to the standard output.
7. Otherwise, output 'No' to the standard output.
8. Increment mae by 1 and usiro by 1 in each iteration.

Function signature: 
- Input: N (integer), K (integer), and a list of N scores (integers)
- Output: N-K 'Yes' or 'No' outputs to the standard output

Variable declarations and data types:
- N: integer
- K: integer
- score: list of integers
- mae: integer
- usiro: integer

Required libraries or modules: 
- input() function for reading from standard input, implicitly available in Python.

Data processing logic:
- Input is processed as integers and a list of integers.
- Comparison logic is applied between elements of the list. 

Control structures:
- for loop iterating N-K times
- if-else conditional statement comparing scores at indices mae and usiro.
