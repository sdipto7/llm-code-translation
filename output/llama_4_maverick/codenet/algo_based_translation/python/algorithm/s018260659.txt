1. Define a function `check_divisibility` with parameter `N` of type integer and return type string.
2. Initialize a variable `cnt` of type integer to 1.
3. Enter a while loop that continues as long as `cnt` is less than or equal to 9.
4. Inside the loop, check the condition `N % cnt == 0` and `1 <= N / cnt <= 9`.
5. If the condition is true, return the string 'Yes'.
6. If the condition is false, increment `cnt` by 1.
7. If the loop completes without finding a valid `cnt`, return the string 'No'.
8. Read an integer input from the user and store it in `N`.
9. Call the function `check_divisibility` with `N` as the argument and print the returned result.
