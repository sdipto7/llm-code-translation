1. Read two integer inputs, N and x, from the standard input, where N is the number of elements and x is the threshold value.
2. Initialize a list 'a' of size N with integer values read from the standard input.
3. Initialize a variable 'cnt' of type integer to 0.
4. Iterate over the list 'a' from the second element (index 1) to the last element.
5. For each element at index 'i', calculate the sum 'tmp' of the current element and its previous element.
6. Check if 'tmp' is greater than 'x'.
7. If 'tmp' is greater than 'x', then check if the difference between 'tmp' and 'x' is greater than the current element 'a[i]'.
8. If the difference is greater than 'a[i]', update 'a[i-1]' to be 'tmp - a[i] - x' and set 'a[i]' to 0.
9. If the difference is not greater than 'a[i]', update 'a[i]' to be 'a[i] - (tmp - x)'.
10. Increment 'cnt' by the difference between 'tmp' and 'x'.
11. After iterating over the entire list, output the value of 'cnt' to the standard output.
