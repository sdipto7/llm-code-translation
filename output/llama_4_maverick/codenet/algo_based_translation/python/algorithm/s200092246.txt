1. Read an integer N from input.
2. Initialize an empty list 'ans'.
3. Iterate over the range from 1 to N (inclusive) using a variable 'i'.
   3.1. Check if the sum of numbers from 1 to 'i' is less than N.
   3.2. If the condition is true, continue to the next iteration.
   3.3. If the condition is false, 
        - Assign a list containing 'i - 1' and the difference between the sum of numbers from 1 to 'i' and N to 'ans'.
        - Exit the loop.
4. Iterate over the range from 0 to 'ans[0]' (exclusive) using a variable 'i'.
   4.1. Check if 'i + 1' is not equal to 'ans[1]'.
   4.2. If the condition is true, print 'i + 1'.
