1. Read three integer inputs from the user and store them in variables A, B, and K.
2. Check if the condition A + K - 1 >= B - K + 1 is true.
3. If the condition is true, execute a loop that starts from A and increments by 1 until it reaches B, printing each value.
4. If the condition is false, execute the following steps:
   4.1. Initialize a counter variable i to 0.
   4.2. Execute a loop that runs until i is less than or equal to K - 1, printing A + i in each iteration and incrementing i by 1.
   4.3. Execute a loop that starts from B - K + 1 and continues until it reaches B, printing the current value in each iteration and decrementing K by 1.

Function Signature: 
- `function processInput(A: integer, B: integer, K: integer) -> void`

Variable Declarations:
- A: integer
- B: integer
- K: integer
- i: integer

Logic Flow:
1. ReadInput(A, B, K)
2. if (A + K - 1 >= B - K + 1) then 
   2.1. while (A <= B) do 
      2.1.1. Print(A)
      2.1.2. A = A + 1
3. else 
   3.1. i = 0
   3.2. while (i <= K - 1) do 
      3.2.1. Print(A + i)
      3.2.2. i = i + 1
   3.3. while (B - K + 1 <= B) do 
      3.3.1. Print(B - K + 1)
      3.3.2. K = K - 1

Input/Output Operations:
- Read three integer inputs from the user.
- Print integer values based on the conditions.

Required Libraries/Modules:
- Input/Output library for reading input and printing output (e.g., `sys.stdin.readline()` and `print()` in Python)
