1. Define a function `calculate_answer` with two integer parameters `X` and `t`, returning an integer.
2. Read two integer inputs from the user and store them in `X` and `t` using a `map` function in combination with the `split` method.
3. Check if `X` is greater than `t`. 
4. If the condition is true, calculate `answer` as the difference between `X` and `t`.
5. If the condition is false, check if `X` is less than or equal to `t`, then set `answer` to 0.
6. Print the calculated `answer` to the console.
7. The program terminates after printing the result.

More formally:
- Function signature: `def calculate_answer(X: int, t: int) -> int`
- Variable declarations: `X: int`, `t: int`, `answer: int`
- Execution order:
  1. Read `X` and `t` from input.
  2. Evaluate the condition `X > t`.
  3. If true, `answer = X - t`.
  4. If false, `answer = 0` because `X <= t`.
  5. Print `answer`.
- Control structure: If-elif statement with conditions `X > t` and `X <= t`.
- Input/Output: Read two integers from input, print one integer to output.
- Data processing: Compare `X` and `t`, perform subtraction if `X > t`.
