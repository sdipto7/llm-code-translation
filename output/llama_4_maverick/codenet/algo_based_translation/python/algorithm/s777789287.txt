1. Define a function `solve` with no parameters and return type `None`.
2. Declare variables `n` and `m` of type `int`.
3. Read two integers from input, split by space, and store them in `n` and `m` respectively.
4. Declare a list `a` of type `list[int]`.
5. Read a list of `n` integers from input, split by space, and store them in `a`.
6. Sort the list `a` in descending order.
7. Declare a variable `s` of type `float`.
8. Calculate the sum of all elements in `a` and divide it by `4*m`, storing the result in `s`.
9. Check if the `m-1`th element of the sorted list `a` is greater than or equal to `s`.
10. If the condition is true, print 'Yes' to output.
11. If the condition is false, print 'No' to output.

Required libraries: built-in Python libraries (`input`, `map`, `list`, `sort`, `sum`, `print`)
