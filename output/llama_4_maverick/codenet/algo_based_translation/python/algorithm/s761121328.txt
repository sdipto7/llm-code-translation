1. Read an integer N from input.
2. Read N integers from input into a list A.
3. Initialize a variable s to the bitwise XOR of the first two elements of A.
4. Iterate from the third element to the Nth element of A (index 2 to N-1), updating s by performing a bitwise XOR operation between s and the current element of A.
5. Create a list B of size N, where each element is initialized to 0.
6. Iterate over the range from 0 to N-1, updating each element of B at index i to be the bitwise XOR of s and the element of A at index i.
7. Convert each element of B to a string and store them in a list L.
8. Join the elements of L into a single string with spaces in between.
9. Output the resulting string.
