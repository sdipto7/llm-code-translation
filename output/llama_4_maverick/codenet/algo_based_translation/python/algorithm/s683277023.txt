1. Define a function `calculate_sum_of_smallest_k_numbers` that takes no parameters and returns an integer.
2. Declare variables `n` and `k` of type integer.
3. Read two integer values from the input and store them in `n` and `k` by splitting the input string.
4. Declare a list `li` to store integers.
5. Read `n` integer values from the input, store them in `li`, and map them to integers.
6. Sort the list `li` in ascending order.
7. Declare a list `tmp` and assign it the first `k` elements of the sorted list `li`.
8. Calculate the sum of the elements in `tmp`.
9. Print the sum of the elements in `tmp`.
10. The program terminates. 

Alternatively in a more structured pseudocode:

1. Function `main` returns integer
2. `n`, `k` = read two integers from input
3. `li` = read `n` integers into a list
4. Sort `li` in-place
5. `tmp` = slice `li` from index 0 to `k`
6. `sum_tmp` = sum of elements in `tmp`
7. Print `sum_tmp`
