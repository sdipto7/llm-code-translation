1. Read six integer inputs from the user and store them in variables x, y, a, b, and c.
2. Read three lists of integers from the user.
3. Sort the first list in descending order and store the top x elements in list p.
4. Sort the second list in descending order and store the top y elements in list q.
5. Sort the third list in descending order and store it in list r.
6. Combine lists p and q into a new list pq, and sort pq in ascending order.
7. Iterate from 0 to the minimum of (x+y, a, b, c) - 1.
8. Inside the loop, check if the current element in pq is less than the corresponding element in r.
9. If the condition is true, replace the current element in pq with the corresponding element from r.
10. Calculate the sum of all elements in pq.
11. Output the sum.
