1. Define a function `main()` with no parameters and no return type.
2. Declare variables `n` and `m` of type integer.
3. Read input and parse it into `n` and `m` using a split operation on whitespace, converting the resulting strings to integers.
4. Declare two empty lists `a` and `b` to store integers.
5. Iterate `m` times using a for loop with loop counter `i`.
6. Inside the loop, read input and parse it into two integers `a1` and `b1` using a split operation on whitespace, converting the resulting strings to integers.
7. Append `a1` and `b1` to lists `a` and `b` respectively.
8. Iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using a for loop with loop counter `i`.
9. Inside the loop, calculate the sum of the counts of `i` in lists `a` and `b`.
10. Print the calculated sum for each `i`.
11. The required library is the built-in Python library, specifically the `input()` function and list operations.
12. The input operations are reading `n` and `m`, and then `m` pairs of integers, followed by printing `n` counts.
