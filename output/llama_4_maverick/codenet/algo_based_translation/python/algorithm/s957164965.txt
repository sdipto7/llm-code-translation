1. Read two inputs: an integer pair (X, N) from the first line and a list of N integers from the second line.
2. Store X and N in integer variables.
3. Store the list of integers in a list data structure.
4. Sort the list of integers in ascending order.
5. Create an empty dictionary to store candidates.
6. Iterate over a range of integers from -1 to 101.
7. For each integer i in the range, check if i is present in the sorted list.
8. If i is not present, calculate the absolute difference between X and i.
9. Check if the absolute difference is already a key in the dictionary.
10. If the key exists, append i to the list of values for that key.
11. If the key does not exist, create a new key-value pair with the absolute difference as the key and a list containing i as the value.
12. Find the smallest key in the dictionary.
13. Retrieve the list of values associated with the smallest key.
14. Find the minimum value in the list.
15. Output the minimum value.
