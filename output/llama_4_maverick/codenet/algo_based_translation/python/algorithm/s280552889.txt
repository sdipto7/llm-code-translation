1. Define a function `calculate_output` with one parameter `N` of type integer and return type integer.
2. Read an integer input from the user and store it in variable `N` of type integer.
3. Check if `N` is even by evaluating the condition `N % 2 == 0`.
4. If the condition is true, calculate the output as `N // 2`.
5. If the condition is false, calculate the output as `N // 2 + 1`.
6. Print the calculated output.
7. The program terminates after printing the output.
