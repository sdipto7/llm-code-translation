1. Read input string and convert it into a list of characters.
2. Initialize an array `mods` of size equal to the length of the input string with all elements as 0.
3. Initialize an array `countRemainder` of size 2019 with all elements as 0.
4. Initialize a variable `cnt` to 0.
5. Initialize a variable `m` to 1 and `mod` to 0.
6. Iterate over the input string from right to left.
7. For each character, update `mod` by adding the integer value of the current character multiplied by `m`, then take the modulus of `mod` with 2019.
8. Update `m` by multiplying it by 10, then take the modulus of `m` with 2019.
9. Increment the count of `mod` in the `countRemainder` array.
10. After the loop, increment the count of 0 in the `countRemainder` array by 1.
11. Iterate over the `countRemainder` array.
12. For each count, calculate the number of combinations using the formula `count * (count - 1) / 2` and add it to `cnt`.
13. Output the value of `cnt`.
