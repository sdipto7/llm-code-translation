1. Import the required library: java.util.Scanner
2. Define a class: Main
3. Define a function: main with parameter args of type String[] and return type void
4. Declare a variable sc of type Scanner and initialize it with a new Scanner object using System.in
5. Declare variables k, a, b of type long
6. Read input from sc into k, a, b using the nextLong() method
7. Check the condition: if b is less than or equal to a + 2
8. If the condition is true, print 1 + k to the console and exit the program
9. If the condition is false, declare a variable x of type long and calculate its value as k - (a - 1)
10. Declare a variable ans of type long and calculate its value as a + (x / 2) * (b - a) + (x % 2)
11. Print the value of ans to the console
