1. Import necessary libraries: 
   - java.io
   - java.util
   - java.math

2. Define a class Main with the following components:
   - Class variables: 
     - sc of type Scanner
     - max and cur of type int
   - Constructor Main() that initializes sc with a new Scanner object reading from System.in

3. Define the main method main(String[] args) that:
   - Creates a new instance of Main
   - Calls the solve() method on the new instance

4. Define the solve() method that:
   - Reads two integers a and b using the ni() method
   - Prints the maximum of 0 and (a - 2*b) to the console

5. Define utility methods for input/output operations:
   - ni(): reads an integer from the scanner and returns it
   - nl(): reads a long from the scanner and returns it
   - nf(): reads a float from the scanner and returns it
   - nd(): reads a double from the scanner and returns it
   - ns(): reads a line from the scanner and returns it as a string
   - nst(String s): returns a StringTokenizer object for the given string
   - ia(int a[]): reads integers from the scanner and stores them in the given array
   - la(long a[]): reads longs from the scanner and stores them in the given array
   - fa(float a[]): reads floats from the scanner and stores them in the given array
   - da(double a[]): reads doubles from the scanner and stores them in the given array
   - sa(String a[], boolean empty): reads strings from the scanner and stores them in the given array, or initializes the array with empty strings if empty is true
   - ida(int a[][], int n, int m): reads integers from the scanner and stores them in the given 2D array
   - lda(long a[][], int n, int m): reads longs from the scanner and stores them in the given 2D array
   - dda(double a[][], int n, int m): reads doubles from the scanner and stores them in the given 2D array

6. Define utility methods for data processing:
   - stoi(String s): converts a string to an integer and returns it
   - stod(String s): converts a string to a double and returns it
   - lmin(long a[]): finds the minimum element in the given long array and returns it
   - imin(int a[]): finds the minimum element in the given integer array and returns it
   - lmax(long a[]): finds the maximum element in the given long array and returns it
   - imax(int a[]): finds the maximum element in the given integer array and returns it
   - ibs(int a[], int toFind): performs a binary search on the given sorted integer array to find the given element and returns a boolean indicating whether it was found
   - lbs(long a[], long toFind): performs a binary search on the given sorted long array to find the given element and returns a boolean indicating whether it was found
   - stb(String s): converts a binary string to an integer and returns it
