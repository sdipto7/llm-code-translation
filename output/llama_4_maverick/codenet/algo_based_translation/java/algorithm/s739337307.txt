1. Import required libraries: java.util and java.math.
2. Define a class Main with a public static void main method taking a String array as input and returning no value.
3. Within the main method:
   - Initialize a try block with a resource (Scanner object sc) to read from System.in.
   - Declare integer variables n and m.
   - Parse the next two input tokens as integers and assign them to n and m respectively.
   - Create a HashMap (map) to store integer key-value pairs.
   - Initialize integer variables countAc and countWaAll to 0.
   - Iterate m times using a for loop:
     - Parse the next input token as an integer and assign it to the variable question.
     - Read the next input token as a string and assign it to the variable waOrAc.
     - Check if the map does not contain the key question:
       - If waOrAc equals "WA", put the key-value pair (question, 1) into the map.
       - If waOrAc equals "AC", put the key-value pair (question, -1) into the map and increment countAc.
     - If the map contains the key question:
       - Retrieve the value associated with question from the map and assign it to countWa.
       - If countWa is not less than 0:
         - If waOrAc equals "WA", replace the value associated with question in the map with countWa + 1.
         - If waOrAc equals "AC", replace the value associated with question in the map with -countWa, increment countAc, and add countWa to countWaAll.
   - Print the values of countAc and countWaAll separated by a space.
   - Catch any exceptions that occur during execution and print their stack trace.
