1. Import required libraries: java.util and java.io.
2. Define a class Main with a public access modifier.
3. Define a static method main with a return type of void and a parameter of type String[] args.
4. Declare a variable sc of type Scanner and initialize it with a new Scanner object that reads from System.in.
5. Start a for loop with:
   - Initialization: Declare a variable i of type int and initialize it to 0.
   - Condition: i is less than 5.
   - Increment: Increment i by 1 after each iteration.
6. Inside the loop, check if the next integer input from sc is equal to 0.
7. If the condition is true, print the value of i + 1 to the console and exit the loop using a break statement.
8. The program terminates after the loop is exited.
