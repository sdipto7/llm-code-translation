1. Import the `java.util` module for using the `Scanner` class.
2. Define a class `Main` with a `main` method that takes an array of `String` arguments and returns `void`.
3. Within the `main` method:
   - Declare an integer variable `count` and initialize it by reading an integer from the standard input using `Scanner(System.in).nextInt()`.
   - Declare an integer variable `total` and initialize it to 0.
   - Declare an integer variable `ix` for loop iteration.
   - Use a `for` loop with the following conditions:
     - Initialize `ix` to 1.
     - Continue the loop as long as `ix` is less than or equal to `count`.
     - Increment `ix` by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - Within the loop, add the current value of `ix` to `total`.
4. After the loop, use `System.out.println` to output the final value of `total` to the standard output.
5. The program terminates after executing the `main` method.
