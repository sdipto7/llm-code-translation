1. Import the required library: java.util.Scanner
2. Define a class: Main
3. Define a function: main with return type void and parameter args of type String[]
4. Declare a variable: stdIn of type Scanner and initialize it with new Scanner(System.in)
5. Declare variables: N and X of type int
6. Read input from stdIn into N and X using nextInt()
7. Declare an array: m of type int with size N
8. Read input from stdIn into m[0] using nextInt()
9. Subtract m[0] from X
10. Declare a variable: min of type int and initialize it with m[0]
11. Loop from i = 1 to N-1 with increment 1
    a. Read input from stdIn into m[i] using nextInt()
    b. Subtract m[i] from X
    c. Check if m[i] is less than min
        i. If true, update min with m[i]
12. Calculate the result by adding N and the integer division of X by min
13. Output the result to the console using System.out.println()
