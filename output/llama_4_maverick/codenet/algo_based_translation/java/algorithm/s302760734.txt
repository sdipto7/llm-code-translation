1. Import required libraries: java.util.Scanner
2. Define a function `main` with signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`
3. Declare variables:
   - `scanner` of type `Scanner`
   - `s` and `t` of type `char[]`
   - `check` of type `boolean`
4. Execute the following steps in order:
   1. Initialize `scanner` by creating a new `Scanner` object with `System.in` as input
   2. Read input from `scanner` using `next()` and convert to `char[]` and store in `s` and `t`
   3. Initialize `check` to `false`
   4. Iterate over `s` in reverse order with index `i` ranging from `s.length - t.length` to `0` (inclusive) with a decrement of 1
      1. Initialize `check2` to `true`
      2. Iterate over `t` with index `j` ranging from `0` to `t.length - 1` (inclusive) with an increment of 1
         1. Check if `s[i + j]` is not equal to `'?'` and not equal to `t[j]`
         2. If the condition is true, set `check2` to `false`
      3. If `check2` is `true`, 
         1. Set `check` to `true`
         2. Iterate over `t` with index `j` ranging from `0` to `t.length - 1` (inclusive) with an increment of 1
            1. Assign `t[j]` to `s[i + j]`
      4. If `check` is `true`, break the loop
   5. If `check` is `true`,
      1. Iterate over `s` with index `i` ranging from `0` to `s.length - 1` (inclusive) with an increment of 1
         1. If `s[i]` is equal to `'?'`, print `"a"`
         2. Otherwise, print `s[i]`
      2. Print a newline character
   6. If `check` is `false`, print `"UNRESTORABLE"` followed by a newline character (implicitly handled by `println`)
