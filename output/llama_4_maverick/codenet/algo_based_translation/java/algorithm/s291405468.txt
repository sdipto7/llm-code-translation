1. Import the required library: java.util.*
2. Define a public class: Main
3. Define a public static method: main with parameter args of type String[]
4. Declare a variable sc of type Scanner and initialize it with a new Scanner object reading from System.in
5. Read an integer from the input using sc.nextInt() and store it in a temporary variable (let's call it num1)
6. Read another integer from the input using sc.nextInt() and store it in another temporary variable (let's call it num2)
7. Calculate the remainder of num1 divided by 500
8. Compare the result from step 7 with num2 using the condition: remainder <= num2
9. Use a conditional expression to return "Yes" if the condition in step 8 is true, otherwise return "No"
10. Print the result from step 9 to the console using System.out.println()
11. The main method returns void, indicating the end of the program. 

Function signature: 
- public static void main(String[] args)

Variable declarations: 
- sc: Scanner
- num1 and num2: integers (temporary variables)

Control structure: 
- Conditional expression (ternary operator) with condition: num1 % 500 <= num2

Input/Output operations: 
- Reading two integers from the input using sc.nextInt()
- Printing the result ("Yes" or "No") to the console using System.out.println()

Data processing logic: 
- Calculating the remainder of the first input number divided by 500
- Comparing the remainder with the second input number

Required libraries: 
- java.util.* (for Scanner class)
