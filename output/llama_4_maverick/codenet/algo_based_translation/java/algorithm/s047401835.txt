1. Define function `readInput()` with return type `int[]`:
   - Declare variable `N` of type `int`
   - Declare list `numbers` of type `int[]`
   - Read `N` from input
   - Read `N` integers from input and store in `numbers`
   - Return `numbers`

2. Define function `processNumbers(numbers: int[])` with return type `int`:
   - Initialize variable `count` to 0
   - Initialize variable `N` to the size of `numbers`
   - Enter a do-while loop that continues as long as the size of `numbers` is equal to `N`
   - Inside the loop:
     - Filter `numbers` to include only even integers
     - Divide each number in `numbers` by 2
     - Update `numbers` with the new list
     - If the size of `numbers` is equal to `N`, increment `count`
   - Exit the loop when the size of `numbers` is not equal to `N`
   - Return `count`

3. Define function `main()`:
   - Call `readInput()` and store the result in `numbers`
   - Call `processNumbers(numbers)` and store the result in `count`
   - Print `count` to output

Required libraries:
- Input/Output library for reading from input and writing to output
- List/Array manipulation library for filtering and mapping numbers

Data types and variable declarations:
- `N`: `int`
- `numbers`: `int[]`
- `count`: `int`
