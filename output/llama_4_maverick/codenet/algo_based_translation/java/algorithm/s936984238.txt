1. Import the required library: java.util
2. Define a class Main with the following components:
   - Static variables: 
     - sc of type Scanner
     - score of type int array
     - number of type int
   - Main method:
     - While loop with condition: read()
     - Inside the loop: slove()
   - Method read() with return type boolean:
     - Read an integer into number using sc.nextInt()
     - If number equals 0, return false
     - Initialize score array with size number
     - For loop with condition: i < number
       - Read an integer into score[i] using sc.nextInt()
     - Return true
   - Method slove() with return type void:
     - Sort the score array using java.util.Arrays.sort()
     - Initialize sum to 0
     - For loop with condition: i = 1 to number-2 (i.e., 1 <= i < number-1)
       - sum = sum + score[i]
     - Print sum/(number-2) to the console using System.out.println()

To translate this into a step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize a Scanner object to read from the standard input.
2. Enter a loop that continues as long as the read() function returns true.
3. Within the loop, call the slove() function.
4. In the read() function:
   4.1. Read an integer from the input into the variable 'number'.
   4.2. If 'number' equals 0, return false to exit the loop in the main method.
   4.3. Create an integer array 'score' of size 'number'.
   4.4. Iterate from 0 to 'number'-1, reading an integer into each index of the 'score' array.
   4.5. Return true to continue the loop in the main method.
5. In the slove() function:
   5.1. Sort the 'score' array in ascending order.
   5.2. Initialize a variable 'sum' to 0.
   5.3. Iterate from index 1 to 'number'-2 (inclusive), adding each 'score' value to 'sum'.
   5.4. Calculate the average by dividing 'sum' by ('number'-2) and print the result to the console.
