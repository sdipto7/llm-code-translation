1. Import the required library: java.util.*
2. Define a class: Main
3. Define a function: main with parameter args of type String[] and return type void
4. Declare a variable: sc of type Scanner and initialize it with new Scanner(System.in)
5. Declare a variable: N of type int and read its value from sc using nextInt()
6. Declare a variable: c of type char[] and read its value from sc using next().toCharArray()
7. Iterate over the array c using a for loop with loop counter i, starting from 0, continuing while i < c.length, and incrementing i by 1 in each iteration
8. Inside the loop, update the value of c[i] using the expression (char)((c[i]-'A'+N) % 26 + 'A')
9. After the loop, print the array c to the console using System.out.println(c)
10. The program terminates after executing the main function.
