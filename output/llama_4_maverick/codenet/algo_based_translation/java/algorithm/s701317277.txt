1. Import required libraries: java.util.*
2. Define a class: Main
3. Define a function: main with parameter args[] of type String and return type void
4. Declare a variable: sc of type Scanner and initialize it with new Scanner(System.in)
5. Declare a variable: N of type int and read its value from sc using nextInt()
6. Declare an array: A of type int[] with size N
7. Declare variables: min of type int and initialize it with Integer.MAX_VALUE, count of type int and initialize it with 0, sum of type long and initialize it with 0
8. Loop from i = 0 to N-1 with increment 1
   1. Read a value from sc using nextInt() and store it in A[i]
   2. Check if A[i] is less than 0
      1. If true, increment count by 1
   3. Update min with the minimum of min and the absolute value of A[i]
   4. Add the absolute value of A[i] to sum
9. Close sc using close()
10. Check if count is even by verifying count % 2 == 0
    1. If true, output sum
    2. If false, output sum - min * 2
