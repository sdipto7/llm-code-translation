1. Import required libraries: java.util and java.io.
2. Define a class Main with a public static method main that takes a String array as input and throws IOException.
3. Declare variables: 
   - BufferedReader br to read input from System.in.
   - PrintWriter pw to write output to System.out.
   - StringTokenizer s to tokenize input strings.
   - Integer n to store the number of input elements.
   - HashMap<Integer, Integer> hm to store frequency of input elements.
   - Integer ans to store the final answer.
   - Integer val to store the current input element being processed.
   - Integer num to store the frequency of the current input element.
4. Execute the following steps in order:
   1. Initialize br with a BufferedReader reading from System.in.
   2. Initialize pw with a PrintWriter writing to System.out.
   3. Read the first line of input using br.readLine() and tokenize it using StringTokenizer.
   4. Parse the first token as an integer and store it in n.
   5. Read the second line of input, tokenize it, and iterate over the tokens.
   6. For each token, parse it as an integer, and update its frequency in hm.
   7. Initialize ans to 0.
   8. Iterate over the keySet of hm.
   9. For each key val, retrieve its frequency num from hm.
   10. If num is greater than val, increment ans by num - val.
   11. Else if num is less than val, increment ans by num.
   12. Write ans to pw using pw.println(ans).
   13. Close pw using pw.close().
