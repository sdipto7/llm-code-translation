1. Import required libraries: 
   - java.util
   - java.lang
   - java.io

2. Define a class `Main` with a `main` method that:
   - Creates a new instance of the `Solution` class

3. Define a class `Solution` with:
   - A constructor that:
     - Initializes a `Scanner` object to read from `System.in`
     - Enters a loop that continues as long as there is input to read (`scanner.hasNext()`)
     - Calls the `run_case` method in each iteration

   - A `run_case` method that:
     - Reads a line from the input using `scanner.nextLine()`
     - Splits the line into two parts using a regular expression (`\\s+`) and parses them into integers `N` and `K`
     - Initializes a variable `len` to 0
     - Enters a loop that continues as long as `N` is greater than 0
     - In each iteration, divides `N` by `K` and increments `len` by 1
     - Prints the value of `len` to the output

   - A `strToIntArray` method that:
     - Takes a `String` as input and splits it into parts using a regular expression (`\\s+`)
     - Creates an integer array of the same length as the number of parts
     - Parses each part into an integer and stores it in the corresponding index in the array
     - Returns the integer array

4. Define a class `LCS` with:
   - A `lcs` method that:
     - Takes two `String`s `A` and `B` as input
     - Initializes a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `(A.length() + 1) x (B.length() + 1)`
     - Initializes the first row and column of `dp` to 0
     - Enters a nested loop that iterates over the characters in `A` and `B`
     - If the current characters in `A` and `B` are the same, sets `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`
     - Otherwise, sets `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]`
     - Returns the value of `dp[A.length()][B.length()]`

   - A `getLCS` method that:
     - Takes two `String`s `X` and `Y` as input
     - Retrieves the length of the LCS from the `dp` array computed by the `lcs` method
     - Creates a character array `lcs` to store the LCS
     - Initializes an index to the last character of the LCS
     - Enters a loop that starts from the bottom-right corner of the `dp` array and moves diagonally up-left if the current characters in `X` and `Y` are the same, or up or left depending on the larger value in `dp`
     - Stores the characters of the LCS in the `lcs` array
     - Returns the LCS as a `String` by converting the `lcs` array to a `String` and truncating it to the correct length

Function signatures:
- `public Solution()`
- `private void run_case()`
- `private int[] strToIntArray(String str)`
- `public int lcs(String A, String B)`
- `public String getLCS(String X, String Y)`

Variable declarations and data types:
- `Scanner scanner`
- `String line`
- `int N`, `K`, `len`
- `int[] res`
- `int[][] dp`
- `int sz_a`, `sz_b`, `m`, `n`, `index`, `temp`, `i`, `j`
- `char[] lcs`

Input/Output operations:
- Reading input using `scanner.nextLine()`
- Printing output using `System.out.println(len)`

Data processing logic:
- Parsing input strings to integers
- Computing the length of the representation of a number in a given base
- Computing the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings using dynamic programming

Required libraries:
- `java.util`
- `java.lang`
- `java.io`
