1. Import required libraries: java.util.HashSet, java.util.Scanner, java.util.Set, java.util.stream.IntStream.
2. Define a function main with parameter args of type String[] and return type void.
3. Declare a variable scanner of type Scanner and initialize it with new Scanner(System.in).
4. Use a try-with-resources statement to ensure the scanner is closed.
5. Declare a variable n of type int and assign it the value returned by scanner.nextInt().
6. Declare a variable set of type Set<Integer> and initialize it with new HashSet<>().
7. Use IntStream.range(0, n) to generate a stream of integers from 0 to n-1.
8. Call forEach on the stream, passing a lambda expression that takes an integer i and adds the value returned by scanner.nextInt() to set.
9. Print the value returned by set.size() to the console using System.out.println().
10. The try-with-resources statement automatically closes the scanner.
