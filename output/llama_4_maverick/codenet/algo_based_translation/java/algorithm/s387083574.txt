1. Import required libraries: java.util.Scanner, java.util.Map, java.util.HashMap, java.util.Map.Entry, java.util.stream.Collectors.
2. Define a function main with parameter args of type String[] and return type void.
3. Declare a variable sc of type Scanner and initialize it with a new Scanner object reading from System.in.
4. Declare a variable N of type int and read its value from sc using the nextInt method.
5. Declare a variable map of type Map<Integer, Integer> and initialize it with a new HashMap object.
6. Iterate from 1 to N (inclusive) using a for loop with loop counter i.
7. Inside the loop, put a key-value pair into map where the key is i and the value is read from sc using the nextInt method.
8. Sort the entries of map by their values in ascending order using the stream API and the comparingByValue method.
9. Extract the keys from the sorted entries using the map method with Map.Entry::getKey.
10. Convert the keys to strings using the map method with String::valueOf.
11. Collect the resulting strings into a list using the collect method with Collectors.toList.
12. Join the strings in the list into a single string separated by spaces using the String.join method.
13. Print the resulting string to the console using System.out.println.
