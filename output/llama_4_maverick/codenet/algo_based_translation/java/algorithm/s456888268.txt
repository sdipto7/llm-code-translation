1. Read a string input from the user.
2. Convert the input string into a character array `s`.
3. Initialize variables: 
   - `n` to store the length of the character array `s`.
   - `ans` to store the count of pairs of 'S' and 'T' in the string, initialized to 0.
   - `cnt` to keep track of the count of 'S' encountered so far, initialized to 0.
4. Iterate through each character in the character array `s` using a for loop with index `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
5. Inside the loop:
   - If the current character `s[i]` is 'S', increment `cnt` by 1.
   - If `s[i]` is 'T':
     - If `cnt` is 0, skip to the next iteration.
     - If `cnt` is not 0, increment `ans` by 1 and decrement `cnt` by 1.
6. After the loop, calculate the result as `n - 2 * ans`.
7. Output the calculated result.
