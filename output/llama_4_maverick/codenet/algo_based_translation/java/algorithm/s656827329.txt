1. Import required libraries: java.util.*
2. Define a class: Main
3. Define a static method: main with parameter args of type String[]
4. Declare a variable sc of type Scanner and initialize it with new Scanner(System.in)
5. Declare a variable n of type int and read its value from sc using nextInt()
6. Declare an array a of size n with elements of type int
7. Iterate from i = 0 to n-1 using a for loop
   1. Read the value of a[i] from sc using nextInt()
8. Declare and initialize variables: count = 1, now = 0, bef = 0
9. Iterate from i = 1 to n-1 using a for loop
   1. Check the condition a[i-1] < a[i] 
      1. If true, set now = 1
   2. Else check the condition a[i-1] > a[i] 
      1. If true, set now = -1
   3. Else (a[i-1] == a[i]) 
      1. Continue to the next iteration of the loop
   4. Check the condition bef == 0 
      1. If true, set bef = now
   5. Check the condition bef != now 
      1. If true, 
         1. Increment count by 1
         2. Set bef = 0
10. Print the value of count to the console using System.out.println() 
11. The main method ends, and the program terminates.
